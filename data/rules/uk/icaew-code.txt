ICAEW CODE OF ETHICS 2025

This Code of Ethics applies from 1 July 2025.

Except as noted in section 1, this Code of Ethics has been derived from the International Ethics Standards
Board of Accountants (IESBA) Code of Ethics issued in August 2024.
Italicised wording in shaded boxes, sets out additional requirements to those set out by IESBA, which
ICAEW considers to be useful or necessary.

GUIDE TO THE CODE
(This Guide is a non-authoritative aid to using the Code.)

Purpose of the Code
1.

The International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence
Standards) (“the Code”) sets out fundamental principles of ethics for professional accountants, reflecting
the profession’s recognition of its public interest responsibility. These principles establish the standard
of behaviour expected of a professional accountant. The fundamental principles are: integrity, objectivity,
professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behaviour.

2.

The Code provides a conceptual framework that professional accountants are to apply in order to
identify, evaluate and address threats to compliance with the fundamental principles. The Code sets out
requirements and application material on various topics to help accountants apply the conceptual
framework to those topics.

3.

In the case of audits, reviews and other assurance engagements, the Code sets out International
Independence Standards, established by the application of the conceptual framework to threats to
independence in relation to these engagements.

How the Code is Structured
4.

The Code contains the following material:
•

Part 1 – Complying with the Code, Fundamental Principles and Conceptual Framework, which
includes the fundamental principles and the conceptual framework and is applicable to all
professional accountants.

•

Part 2 – Professional Accountants in Business, which sets out additional material that applies to
professional accountants in business when performing professional activities. Professional
accountants in business include professional accountants employed, engaged or contracted in an
executive or non-executive capacity in, for example:
o

Commerce, industry or service.

o

The public sector.

o

Education.

o

The not-for-profit sector.

o

Regulatory or professional bodies.

Part 2 is also applicable to individuals who are professional accountants in public practice when
performing professional activities pursuant to their relationship with the firm, whether as a
contractor, employee or owner.

5.

•

Part 3 – Professional Accountants in Public Practice, which sets out additional material that applies
to professional accountants in public practice when providing professional services.

•

International Independence Standards, which sets out additional material that applies to
professional accountants in public practice when providing assurance services, as follows:
o

Part 4A – Independence for Audit and Review Engagements, which applies when
performing audit or review engagements.

o

Part 4B – Independence for Assurance Engagements Other than Audit and Review
Engagements, which applies when performing assurance engagements that are not audit
or review engagements.

•

Part 10-Insolvency. Insolvency Practitioners in the UK have to comply with the Insolvency Code. The
Insolvency Code is currently part of the ICAEW Code but is set out in a separate document.

•

Glossary, which contains defined terms (together with additional explanations where appropriate) and
described terms which have a specific meaning in certain parts of the Code. For example, as noted
in the Glossary, in Part 4A, the term “audit engagement” applies equally to both audit and review
engagements. The Glossary also includes lists of abbreviations that are used in the Code and other
standards to which the Code refers.

The Code contains sections which address specific topics. Some sections contain subsections dealing
GUIDE TO THE CODE Page 3 of 226

with specific aspects of those topics. Each section of the Code is structured, where appropriate, as
follows:
•

Introduction – sets out the subject matter addressed within the section, and introduces the
requirements and application material in the context of the conceptual framework. Introductory
material contains information, including an explanation of terms used, which is important to the
understanding and application of each Part and its sections.

•

Requirements – establish general and specific obligations with respect to the subject matter
addressed.

•

Application material – provides context, explanations, suggestions for actions or matters to
consider, illustrations and other guidance to assist in complying with the requirements.

How to Use the Code
The Fundamental Principles, Independence and Conceptual Framework
6.

The Code requires professional accountants to comply with the fundamental principles of ethics. The
Code also requires them to apply the conceptual framework to identify, evaluate and address threats to
compliance with the fundamental principles. Applying the conceptual framework requires having an
inquiring mind, exercising professional judgement, and using the reasonable and informed third party
test.

7.

The conceptual framework recognises that the existence of conditions, policies and procedures
established by the profession, legislation, regulation, the firm, or the employing organisation might impact
the identification of threats. Those conditions, policies and procedures might also be a relevant factor in
the professional accountant’s evaluation of whether a threat is at an acceptable level. When threats are
not at an acceptable level, the conceptual framework requires the accountant to address those threats.
Applying safeguards is one way that threats might be addressed. Safeguards are actions individually or
in combination that the accountant takes that effectively reduce threats to an acceptable level.

8.

In addition, the Code requires professional accountants to be independent when performing audit, review
and other assurance engagements. The conceptual framework applies in the same way to identifying,
evaluating and addressing threats to independence as to threats to compliance with the fundamental
principles.

9.

Complying with the Code requires knowing, understanding and applying:
•

All of the relevant provisions of a particular section in the context of Part 1, together with the
additional material set out in Sections 200, 300, 400 and 900, as applicable.

•

All of the relevant provisions of a particular section, for example, applying the provisions that are
set out under the subheadings titled “General” and “All Audit Clients” together with additional
specific provisions, including those set out under the subheadings titled “Audit Clients that are not
Public Interest Entities” or “Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities.”

•

All of the relevant provisions set out in a particular section together with any additional provisions
set out in any relevant subsection.

Requirements and Application Material
10.

Requirements and application material are to be read and applied with the objective of complying with
the fundamental principles, applying the conceptual framework and, when performing audit, review and
other assurance engagements, being independent.

Requirements
11.

Requirements are designated with the letter “R” and, in most cases, include the word “shall.” The word
“shall” in the Code imposes an obligation on a professional accountant or firm to comply with the specific
provision in which “shall” has been used.

12.

In some situations, the Code provides a specific exception to a requirement. In such a situation, the
provision is designated with the letter “R” but uses “may” or conditional wording.

13.

When the word “may” is used in the Code, it denotes permission to take a particular action in certain
circumstances, including as an exception to a requirement. It is not used to denote possibility.

14.

When the word “might” is used in the Code, it denotes the possibility of a matter arising, an event
occurring or a course of action being taken. The term does not ascribe any particular level of possibility
GUIDE TO THE CODE Page 4 of 226

or likelihood when used in conjunction with a threat, as the evaluation of the level of a threat depends
on the facts and circumstances of any particular matter, event or course of action.
Application Material
15.

In addition to requirements, the Code contains application material that provides context relevant to a
proper understanding of the Code. In particular, the application material is intended to help a professional
accountant to understand how to apply the conceptual framework to a particular set of circumstances
and to understand and comply with a specific requirement. While such application material does not of
itself impose a requirement, consideration of the material is necessary to the proper application of the
requirements of the Code, including application of the conceptual framework. Application material is
designated with the letter “A.”

16.

Where application material includes lists of examples, these lists are not intended to be exhaustive.

Professional accountants who are in doubt as to their ethical position may seek advice from the following
sources, available to all members of ICAEW:
•

ICAEW’s Technical Advisory Services by phone +44 (0)1908 248 250 or webchat: Live web chat

•

The ICAEW website also includes help sheets and answers to a number of frequently asked questions:
Technical Advisory Services helpsheets

•

The Support Members Scheme which is run by volunteer members of the ICAEW from a wide range of
backgrounds. It is a confidential, free service exempt from the duty to report misconduct and provides
support to members in difficulties. A member can contact the Support Members Scheme by phone on
+44 (0)800 917 3526.

Both services are confidential and enquiries are treated in strict confidence by the advisors and volunteers,
who are exempt from the ICAEW duty to report misconduct. Hence details will not be divulged to third
parties, including other departments of ICAEW, requested or consented to, except in cases where the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 applies.

SECTION 1-SCOPE AND AUTHORITY
(This Code of Ethics applies from 1 July 2025.)
Introduction
1.1

One of the principal objects of the Royal Charter is to maintain a high standard of efficiency and
professional conduct by members of ICAEW. The Code of Ethics (‘the Code’) applies to all members of
ICAEW (which for the purposes of the Code also includes affiliates, provisional members, foundation
qualification holders, provisional foundation qualification holders and employees of a member firm or an
affiliate) and member firms where relevant. These are referred to in the remainder of the Code as
professional accountants.

Scope
R1.2

Professional accountants shall follow the guidance contained in the fundamental principles and
specific requirements of the Code in all of their professional and business activities whether
carried out with or without reward and in other circumstances where to fail to do so would bring
discredit to the profession.

1.2A1

For convenience, the illustrations in the Code are grouped into parts applicable to professional
accountants working in different spheres of activity. However, the specific requirements in any section,
apply where circumstances are the same as, or analogous to, those addressed by those requirements.

1.2A2

Failure to follow the specific requirements may be justified in those rare circumstances where to follow a
precise prohibition or mandated action would result in failure to adhere to the fundamental principles.

R1.3

Professional accountants shall be guided not merely by the terms but also by the spirit of the Code
and the fact that particular conduct does not appear among a list of examples does not prevent it
amounting to misconduct.

R1.4

Professional accountants shall ensure that work for which they are responsible, which is
undertaken by others on their behalf, is carried out in accordance with the requirements of this
Code.

1.4A1

Member firms are reminded that this Code applies to their employees, whether members or not, and that
they are responsible for applying this requirement.

Authority
1.5A1

Failure to follow this Code may lead to a professional accountant becoming liable to disciplinary action as
outlined in Disciplinary Bye-law 4,

1.5A2

In determining whether or not a complaint is proved, the Conduct Committee and the Tribunal may have
regard to any code of practice, ethical or technical, and to any regulations affecting professional
accountants.

1.5A3

Paragraph R120.3 requires professional accountants to apply the conceptual framework to identify,
evaluate and address threats to compliance with the fundamental principles. In the event of a complaint,
the Conduct Committee and the Tribunal will consider the matter, including whether a reasonable and
informed third party test would conclude, weighing all the specific facts and circumstances available to the
professional accountant at that time, that compliance with the fundamental principles is compromised.

Relationship with other requirements
1.6A1

Except as noted below, the Code has been derived from the International Ethics Standards Board of
Accountants (IESBA) Code of Ethics issued in August 2024. Accordingly, compliance with the remainder
of the Code will ensure compliance with the principles of the IESBA Code. Paragraph numbering in the
rest of this Code replicates that used in the IESBA Code of Ethics, except in respect of:
•

Sections 1, 331 and Part 10 which have no direct equivalent in the IESBA Code of Ethics; and

PREFACE Page 10 of 226

•

Text in shaded boxes in the other sections, where additional discussion and/or requirements have
been considered by ICAEW to be useful or necessary.

1.6A2

In accordance with UK legislation, ICAEW has adopted, as regards auditor independence requirements,
the Ethical Standard for Auditors, issued by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’). Therefore, when
conducting audit engagements in accordance with ISAs (UK), and other public interest assurance
engagements in the UK, professional accountants shall comply with the requirements of the FRC’s Ethical
Standard for Auditors rather than the detailed provisions of part 4A of the Code. For other audit and
assurance engagements part 4A may apply. This is explained in further detail in section 400.

1.6A3

Certain areas of work are reserved by statute to particular regulated individuals and firms, namely
investment business, insolvency, audit and reserved legal services. In these areas professional
accountants may be subject to rules laid down by laws and regulation, breach of which can give rise to
disciplinary proceedings against the professional accountant.

1.6A4

If the requirements in the Code conflict with relevant laws and regulations, professional accountants are
bound to follow the laws and regulations.

Sources of Guidance
1.7.A1

Professional accountants who are in doubt as to their ethical position may seek advice from the following
sources, available to all members of ICAEW:
•

ICAEW’s Technical Advisory Services by phone +44 (0)1908 248 250 or webchat: Live web chat
The ICAEW website also includes help sheets and answers to a number of frequently asked
questions: Technical Advisory Services helpsheets

•

The Support Members Scheme which is run by volunteer members of the ICAEW from a wide range
of backgrounds. It is a confidential, free service exempt from the duty to report misconduct and
provides support to members in difficulties. A member can contact the Support Members Scheme
by phone on +44 (0)800 917 3526.

Both services are confidential, and enquiries are treated in strict confidence by the advisors and
volunteers, who are exempt from the ICAEW duty to report misconduct. Hence details will not be divulged
to third parties, including other departments of ICAEW, requested or consented to, except in cases where
the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 applies.
1.7A2

Seeking advice from the Technical Advisory Services does not discharge a professional accountant’s duty
to report misconduct as outlined in Disciplinary Bye-law 6.1, including their own misconduct.

1.7A3

A professional accountant is encouraged to consider taking legal advice to resolve issues arising from the
application of laws and regulations to particular situations relating to confidentiality, disclosure, privilege,
self-incrimination and other areas.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
SECTION 100
COMPLYING WITH THE CODE
Introduction
100.1

1001.A1

100.2

A distinguishing mark of the accountancy profession is its acceptance of the responsibility to act
in the public interest.
A professional accountant’s responsibility is not exclusively to satisfy the needs of an individual
client or employing organisation. Therefore, the Code contains requirements and application
material to enable professional accountants to meet their responsibility to act in the public
interest”.
Confidence in the accountancy profession is a reason why businesses, governments and other
organisations involve professional accountants in a broad range of areas, including financial and
corporate reporting, assurance and other professional activities. Accountants understand and
acknowledge that such confidence is based on the skills and values that accountants bring to
the professional activities they undertake, including:
(a)

Adherence to ethical principles and professional standards;

(b)

Use of business acumen;

(c)

Application of expertise on technical and other matters; and

(d)

Exercise of professional judgement.

The application of these skills and values enables accountants to provide advice or other output
that meets the purpose for which it was provided, and which can be relied upon by the intended
users of such output.
100.3

The Code sets out high quality standards of ethical behaviour expected of professional
accountants for adoption by professional accountancy organisations which are members of the
International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), or for use by such members as a basis for their
codes of ethics. The Code may also be used or adopted by those responsible for setting ethics
standards for professional accountants in particular sectors or jurisdictions and by firms in
developing their ethics and independence policies.

100.4

The Code establishes five fundamental principles to be complied with by all professional
accountants. It also includes a conceptual framework that sets out the approach to be taken to
identify, evaluate and address threats to compliance with those fundamental principles and, for
audits and other assurance engagements, threats to independence. The Code also applies the
fundamental principles and the conceptual framework to a range of facts and circumstances that
accountants might encounter, whether in business or in public practice.

Requirements and Application Material
100.5 A1

The requirements in the Code, designated with the letter “R,” impose obligations.

100.5 A2

Application material, designated with the letter “A,” provides context, explanations, suggestions
for actions or matters to consider, illustrations and other guidance relevant to a proper
understanding of the Code. In particular, the application material is intended to help a
professional accountant to understand how to apply the conceptual framework to a particular set
of circumstances and to understand and comply with a specific requirement. While such
application material does not of itself impose a requirement, consideration of the material is
necessary to the proper application of the requirements of the Code, including application of the
conceptual framework.

SECTION 100 Page 13 of 226

THE CODE

R100.6

A professional accountant shall comply with the Code.

100.6 A1

Upholding the fundamental principles and compliance with the specific requirements of the Code
enable professional accountants to meet their responsibility to act in the public interest.

100.6 A2

Complying with the Code includes giving appropriate regard to the aim and intent of the specific
requirements.

100.6 A3

Compliance with the requirements of the Code does not mean that professional accountants will
have always met their responsibility to act in the public interest. There might be unusual or
exceptional circumstances in which an accountant believes that complying with a requirement or
requirements of the Code might not be in the public interest or would lead to a disproportionate
outcome. In those circumstances, the accountant is encouraged to consult with an appropriate
body such as a professional or regulatory body.

100.6 A4

In acting in the public interest, a professional accountant considers not only the preferences or
requirements of an individual client or employing organisation, but also the interests of other
stakeholders when performing professional activities.

R100.7

If there are circumstances where laws or regulations preclude a professional accountant from
complying with certain parts of the Code, those laws and regulations prevail, and the accountant
shall comply with all other parts of the Code.

100.7 A1

The principle of professional behaviour requires a professional accountant to comply with
relevant laws and regulations. Some jurisdictions might have provisions that differ from or go
beyond those set out in the Code. Accountants in those jurisdictions need to be aware of those
differences and comply with the more stringent provisions unless prohibited by law or regulation.

Breaches of the Code
R100.8

100.8 A1

Paragraphs R400.80 to R400.89 and R900.50 to R900.55 address a breach of International
Independence Standards. A professional accountant who identifies a breach of any other
provision of the Code shall evaluate the significance of the breach and its impact on the
accountant’s ability to comply with the fundamental principles. The accountant shall also:
(a)

Take whatever actions might be available, as soon as possible, to address the
consequences of the breach satisfactorily; and

(b)

Determine whether to report the breach to the relevant parties.

Relevant parties to whom such a breach might be reported include those who might have been
affected by it, a professional or regulatory body or an oversight authority.

SECTION 100 Page 14 of 226

THE CODE

SECTION 110
THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
General
110.1 A1

There are five fundamental principles of ethics for professional accountants:
(a)

Integrity – to be straightforward and honest in all professional and business relationships.

(b)

Objectivity – to exercise professional or business judgement without being compromised
by:

(c)

(i)

Bias;

(ii)

Conflict of interest; or

(iii)

Undue influence of, or undue reliance on, individuals, organisations, technology or
other factors.

Professional Competence and Due Care – to:
(i)

Attain and maintain professional knowledge and skill at the level required to ensure
that a client or employing organisation receives competent professional service,
based on current technical and professional standards and relevant legislation; and

(ii)

Act diligently and in accordance with applicable technical and professional
standards.

(d)

Confidentiality – to respect the confidentiality of information acquired as a result of
professional and business relationships.

(e)

Professional Behaviour – to:
(i)

Comply with relevant laws and regulations;

(ii)

Behave in a manner consistent with the profession’s responsibility to act in the public
interest in all professional activities and business relationships; and

(iii)

Avoid any conduct that the professional accountant knows or should know might
discredit the profession.

R110.2

A professional accountant shall comply with each of the fundamental principles.

110.2 A1

The fundamental principles of ethics establish the standard of behaviour expected of a
professional accountant. The conceptual framework establishes the approach which an
accountant is required to apply in complying with those fundamental principles. Subsections 111
to 115 set out requirements and application material related to each of the fundamental
principles.

110.2 A2

A professional accountant might face a situation in which complying with one fundamental
principle conflicts with complying with one or more other fundamental principles. In such a
situation, the accountant might consider consulting, on an anonymous basis if necessary, with:
•

Others within the firm or employing organisation.

•

Those charged with governance.

•

A professional body.

•

A regulatory body.

•

Legal counsel.

However, such consultation does not relieve the accountant from the responsibility to exercise
professional judgement to resolve the conflict or, if necessary, and unless prohibited by law or
regulation, disassociate from the matter creating the conflict.
110.2 A3

The professional accountant is encouraged to document the substance of the issue, the details
of any discussions, the decisions made and the rationale for those decisions.

SECTION 110 Page 15 of 226

THE CODE

SUBSECTION 111 – INTEGRITY
R111.1

A professional accountant shall comply with the principle of integrity, which requires an
accountant to be straightforward and honest in all professional and business relationships.

111.1 A1

Integrity involves fair dealing, truthfulness and having the strength of character to act
appropriately, even when facing pressure to do otherwise or when doing so might create potential
adverse personal or organisational consequences.

111.1 A2

Acting appropriately involves:
(a)

Standing one’s ground when confronted by dilemmas and difficult situations; or

(b)

Challenging others as and when circumstances warrant,

in a manner appropriate to the circumstances.
R111.2

A professional accountant shall not knowingly be associated with reports, returns,
communications or other information where the accountant believes that the information:
(a)

Contains a materially false or misleading statement;

(b)

Contains statements or information provided recklessly; or

(c)

Omits or obscures required information where such omission or obscurity would be
misleading.

111.2 A1

If a professional accountant provides a modified report in respect of such a report, return,
communication or other information, the accountant is not in breach of paragraph R111.2.

R111.3

When a professional accountant becomes aware of having been associated with information
described in paragraph R111.2, the accountant shall take steps to be disassociated from that
information.

SUBSECTION 112 – OBJECTIVITY
R112.1

112.1 A1

R112.2

A professional accountant shall comply with the principle of objectivity, which requires an
accountant to exercise professional or business judgement without being compromised by:
(a)

Bias;

(b)

Conflict of interest; or

(c)

Undue influence of, or undue reliance on, individuals, organisations, technology or other
factors.

Objectivity is the state of mind which has regard to all considerations relevant to the task in
hand but no other.
A professional accountant shall not undertake a professional activity if a circumstance or
relationship unduly influences the accountant’s professional judgement regarding that activity.

SUBSECTION 113 – PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE AND DUE CARE
R113.1

A professional accountant shall comply with the principle of professional competence and due
care, which requires an accountant to:
(a)

Attain and maintain professional knowledge and skills at the level required to ensure that a
client or employing organisation receives competent professional service, based on current
technical and professional standards and relevant legislation; and

(b)

Act diligently and in accordance with applicable technical and professional standards.

113.1 A1

Serving clients and employing organisations with professional competence involves the exercise
of sound judgement in applying professional knowledge and skills.

113.1 A2

The knowledge and skills necessary for a professional activity vary depending on the nature of
the activity being undertaken. For example, in addition to the application of any technical
knowledge relevant to the professional activity, interpersonal, communication and organisational
SECTION 110 Page 16 of 226

THE CODE

skills facilitate the professional accountant’s interaction with entities and individuals with whom
the accountant interacts.
113.1 A3

Maintaining professional competence requires a professional accountant to have a continuing
awareness and understanding of technical, professional, business and technology-related
developments relevant to the professional activities undertaken by the accountant. Continuing
professional development enables an accountant to develop and maintain the capabilities to
perform competently within the professional environment.

113.1 A4

Diligence encompasses the responsibility to act in accordance with the requirements of an
assignment, carefully, thoroughly and on a timely basis.

R113.2

In complying with the principle of professional competence and due care, a professional
accountant shall take reasonable steps to ensure that those working in a professional capacity
under the accountant’s authority have appropriate training and supervision.

R113.3

Where appropriate, a professional accountant shall make clients, the employing organisation, or
other users of the accountant’s professional activities, aware of the limitations inherent in the
activities and explain the implications of those limitations.

SUBSECTION 114 – CONFIDENTIALITY
114.0 A1

R114.1

The principle of confidentiality is not only to keep information confidential, but also to take all
reasonable steps to preserve confidentiality. Whether information is confidential or not will
depend on its nature. A safe and proper approach for professional accountants to adopt is to
assume that all unpublished information about a client’s or employer’s affairs, however gained,
is confidential. Some clients or employers may regard the mere fact of their relationship with a
professional accountant as being confidential.
A professional accountant shall comply with the principle of confidentiality, which requires an
accountant to respect the confidentiality of information acquired in the course of professional and
business relationships. An accountant shall:
(a)

Be alert to the possibility of inadvertent disclosure, including in a social environment, and
particularly to a close business associate or an immediate or a close family member;

(b)

Maintain confidentiality of information within the firm or employing organisation;

(c)

Maintain confidentiality of information disclosed by a prospective client or employing
organisation; and

(d)

Take reasonable steps to ensure that personnel under the accountant’s control, and
individuals from whom advice and assistance are obtained, comply with the accountant’s
duty of confidentiality.

114.1 A1

Maintaining the confidentiality of information acquired in the course of professional and business
relationships involves the professional accountant taking appropriate action to protect the
confidentiality of such information in the course of its collection, use, transfer, storage or retention,
dissemination and lawful destruction.

R114.2

Subject to paragraph R114.3, a professional accountant shall not:
(a)

Disclose confidential information acquired in the course of professional and business
relationships;

(b)

Use confidential information acquired in the course of professional and business
relationships for the advantage of the accountant, the firm, the employing organisation or
a third party;

(c)

Use or disclose any confidential information, either acquired or received in the course of a
professional or business relationship, after that relationship has ended; and

(d)

Use or disclose information in respect of which the duty of confidentiality applies
notwithstanding that the information has become publicly available, whether properly or
improperly.
SECTION 110 Page 17 of 226

THE CODE

R114.3

114.3 A1

As an exception to paragraph R114.2, a professional accountant may disclose or use confidential
information where:
(a)

There is a legal or professional duty or right to do so; or

(b)

This is authorised by the client or any person with the authority to permit disclosure or use
of the confidential information and this is not prohibited by law or regulation.

Confidentiality serves the public interest because it facilitates the free flow of information from
the professional accountant’s client or employing organisation to the accountant in the
knowledge that the information will not be disclosed to a third party. Nevertheless, the following
are circumstances where professional accountants might be required or have the duty or right to
disclose confidential information:
(a)

(b)

114.3 A2

114.3 A3

Disclosure is required by law or regulation, for example:
(i)

Production of documents or other provision of evidence in the course of legal
proceedings; or

(ii)

Disclosure to the appropriate public authorities of infringements of the law that come
to light; and

There is a professional duty or right to disclose or use, when not prohibited by law or
regulation:
(i)

To comply with the quality review of a professional body;

(ii)

To respond to an inquiry or investigation by a professional or regulatory body;

(iii)

To protect the professional interests of a professional accountant in legal
proceedings; or

(iv)

To comply with technical and professional standards, including ethics requirements.

In deciding whether to disclose or use confidential information, factors to consider, depending on
the circumstances, include:
•

Whether the interests of any parties, including third parties whose interests might be
affected, could be harmed if the client or employing organisation authorises the disclosure
or use of information by the professional accountant.

•

Whether all the relevant information is known and substantiated, to the extent practicable.
Factors affecting the decision to disclose or use the information include:
o

Unsubstantiated facts.

o

Incomplete information.

o

Unsubstantiated conclusions.

•

The proposed means of communicating the information.

•

Whether the parties to whom the information is to be provided or access is to be granted
are appropriate recipients.

•

Any applicable law or regulation (including those governing privacy) in a jurisdiction where
disclosure might take place and, if different, the jurisdiction where the confidential
information originates.

The circumstances in which a firm or employing organisation seeks authorisation to use or
disclose confidential information, include where the information is to be used for training
purposes, in the development of products or technology, in research or as source material for
industry or other benchmarking data or studies. Such authorisation might be general in its
application (for example, in relation to use of the information for internal training purposes or
quality enhancement initiatives). When obtaining the authorisation of the individual or entity that
provided such information for use in specific circumstances, relevant considerations to be
communicated (preferably in writing) might include:
•

The nature of the information to be used or disclosed.

•

The purpose for which the information is to be used or disclosed (for example, technology
development, research or benchmarking data or studies).

SECTION 110 Page 18 of 226

THE CODE

R114.4

114.2 A1

•

The individual or entity who will undertake the activity for which the information is to be
used or disclosed.

•

Whether the identity of the individual or entity that provided such information or any
individuals or entities to which such information relates will be identifiable from the output
of the activity for which the information is to be used or disclosed.

A professional accountant shall continue to comply with the principle of confidentiality even after
the end of the relationship between the accountant and a client or employing organisation. When
changing employment or acquiring a new client, the accountant is entitled to use prior experience
but shall not use or disclose any confidential information acquired or received in the course of a
professional or business relationship.
This requirement extends not only to clients, past and present, but also to third parties from or
about whom information has been received in confidence. The principle of confidentiality clearly
does not prevent an employee from using the skills acquired while working with a former
employer in undertaking a new role with a different organisation. It would not be appropriate
for professional accountants to either use or appear to use special knowledge which could only
have been acquired with access to confidential information. It is a matter of judgement as to
the dividing line which separates experience gained from special knowledge acquired.

SUBSECTION 115 – PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOUR
R115.1

A professional accountant shall comply with the principle of professional behaviour, which
requires an accountant to:
(a)

Comply with relevant laws and regulations;

(b)

Behave in a manner consistent with the profession’s responsibility to act in the public
interest in all professional activities and business relationships; and

(c)

Avoid any conduct that the accountant knows or should know might discredit the
profession.

A professional accountant shall not knowingly engage in any business, occupation or activity that
impairs or might impair the integrity, objectivity or good reputation of the profession, and as a
result would be incompatible with the fundamental principles.
115.1 A1

115.1 A2

R115.2

Conduct that might discredit the profession includes conduct that a reasonable and informed third
party would be likely to conclude adversely affects the good reputation of the profession.
A reasonable and informed third party would expect that a professional accountant, in
their professional life, treats others fairly, with respect and dignity and, for example,
does not bully, harass, victimise or unfairly discriminate against others.
When undertaking marketing or promotional activities, a professional accountant shall not bring
the profession into disrepute. A professional accountant shall be honest and truthful and shall
not make:
(a)

Exaggerated claims for the services offered by, or the qualifications or experience of, the
accountant; or

(b)

Disparaging references or unsubstantiated comparisons to the work of others.

115.2 A1

If a professional accountant is in doubt about whether a form of advertising or marketing is
appropriate, the accountant is encouraged to consult with the relevant professional body.

R115.3

Professional accountants shall never promote or seek to promote their services, or the
services of other professional accountants, in such a way, or to such an extent, as to
amount to harassment of a potential client or employer.

SECTION 110 Page 19 of 226

THE CODE

SECTION 120
THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
Introduction
120.1

The circumstances in which professional accountants operate might create threats to compliance
with the fundamental principles. Section 120 sets out requirements and application material,
including a conceptual framework, to assist accountants in complying with the fundamental
principles and meeting their responsibility to act in the public interest. Such requirements and
application material accommodate the wide range of facts and circumstances, including the
various professional activities, interests and relationships, that create threats to compliance with
the fundamental principles. In addition, they deter accountants from concluding that a situation
is permitted solely because that situation is not specifically prohibited by the Code.

120.2

The conceptual framework specifies an approach for a professional accountant to:
(a)

Identify threats to compliance with the fundamental principles;

(b)

Evaluate the threats identified; and

(c)

Address the threats by eliminating or reducing them to an acceptable level.

Requirements and Application Material
General
R120.3

The professional accountant shall apply the conceptual framework to identify, evaluate and
address threats to compliance with the fundamental principles set out in Section 110.

120.3 A1

Additional requirements and application material that are relevant to the application of the
conceptual framework are set out in:
(a)

Part 2 – Professional Accountants in Business;

(b)

Part 3 – Professional Accountants in Public Practice; and

(c)

International Independence Standards, as follows:

(d)

(i)

Part 4A – Independence for Audit and Review Engagements; and

(ii)

Part 4B – Independence for assurance engagements Other than Audit and Review
Engagements.

Part 10-Insolvency.

R120.4

When dealing with an ethics issue, the professional accountant shall consider the context in
which the issue has arisen or might arise. Where an individual who is a professional accountant
in public practice is performing professional activities pursuant to the accountant’s relationship
with the firm, whether as a contractor, employee or owner, the individual shall comply with the
provisions in Part 2 that apply to these circumstances.

R120.5

When applying the conceptual framework, the professional accountant shall:
(a)

Have an inquiring mind;

(b)

Exercise professional judgement; and

(c)

Use the reasonable and informed third party test described in paragraph 120.5 A9.

Having an Inquiring Mind
120.5 A1

An inquiring mind is a prerequisite to obtaining an understanding of known facts and
circumstances necessary for the proper application of the conceptual framework. Having an
inquiring mind involves:
(a)

Considering the source, relevance and sufficiency of information obtained, taking into
account the nature, scope and outputs of the professional activity being undertaken; and

(b)

Being open and alert to a need for further investigation or other action.

SECTION 120 Page 20 of 226

THE CODE

120.5 A2

120.5 A3

When considering the source, relevance and sufficiency of information obtained, the professional
accountant might consider, among other matters, whether:
•

New information has emerged or there have been changes in facts and circumstances.

•

The information or its source might be influenced by bias or self-interest.

•

There is reason to be concerned that potentially relevant information might be missing from
the facts and circumstances known to the accountant.

•

There is an inconsistency between the known facts and circumstances and the
accountant’s expectations.

•

The information provides a reasonable basis on which to reach a conclusion.

•

There might be other reasonable conclusions that could be reached from the information
obtained.

Paragraph R120.5 requires all professional accountants to have an inquiring mind when
identifying, evaluating and addressing threats to the fundamental principles. This prerequisite for
applying the conceptual framework applies to all accountants regardless of the professional
activity undertaken. Under auditing, review and other assurance standards, including those
issued by the IAASB, accountants are also required to exercise professional scepticism, which
includes a critical assessment of evidence.

Exercising Professional Judgement
120.5 A4

Professional judgement involves the application of relevant training, professional knowledge, skill
and experience commensurate with the facts and circumstances, taking into account the nature
and scope of the particular professional activities, and the interests and relationships involved.

120.5 A5

Professional judgement is required when the professional accountant applies the conceptual
framework in order to make informed decisions about the courses of actions available, and to
determine whether such decisions are appropriate in the circumstances. In making this
determination, the accountant might consider matters such as whether:
•

The accountant’s expertise and experience are sufficient to reach a conclusion.

•

There is a need to consult with others with relevant expertise or experience.

•

The accountant’s own preconception or bias might be affecting the accountant’s exercise
of professional judgement.

120.5 A6

The circumstances in which professional accountants carry out professional activities and the
factors involved vary considerably in their range and complexity. The professional judgement
exercised by accountants might need to take into account the complexity arising from the
compounding effect of the interaction between, and changes in, elements of the facts and
circumstances that are uncertain and variables and assumptions that are interconnected or
interdependent.

120.5 A7

Managing complexity involves:
•

•

120.5 A8

Making the firm or employing organisation and, if appropriate, relevant stakeholders aware
of the inherent uncertainties or difficulties arising from the facts and circumstances. (Ref:
Para. R113.3)
Being alert to any developments or changes in the facts and circumstances and assessing
whether they might impact any judgements the accountant has made. (Ref: Para. R120.5
to 120.5 A3, and R120.9 to 120.9 A2)

Managing complexity might also involve:
•
•
•

Analysing and investigating as relevant, any uncertain elements, the variables and
assumptions and how they are connected or interdependent.
Using technology to analyse relevant data to inform the professional accountant’s
judgement.
Consulting with others, including experts, to ensure appropriate challenge and additional
input as part of the evaluation process.

SECTION 120 Page 21 of 226

THE CODE

Reasonable and Informed Third Party
120.5 A9

The reasonable and informed third party test is a consideration by the professional accountant
about whether the same conclusions would likely be reached by another party. Such
consideration is made from the perspective of a reasonable and informed third party, who weighs
all the relevant facts and circumstances that the accountant knows, or could reasonably be
expected to know, at the time the conclusions are made. The reasonable and informed third party
does not need to be an accountant, but would possess the relevant knowledge and experience
to understand and evaluate the appropriateness of the accountant’s conclusions in an impartial
manner.

Identifying Threats
R120.6

The professional accountant shall identify threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.

120.6 A1

An understanding of the facts and circumstances, including any professional activities, interests
and relationships that might compromise compliance with the fundamental principles, is a
prerequisite to the professional accountant’s identification of threats to such compliance. The
existence of certain conditions, policies and procedures established by the profession,
legislation, regulation, the firm, or the employing organisation that can enhance the accountant
acting ethically might also help identify threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.
Paragraph 120.8 A2 includes general examples of such conditions, policies and procedures
which are also factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats.

120.6 A2

Threats to compliance with the fundamental principles might be created by a broad range of facts
and circumstances. It is not possible to define every situation that creates threats. In addition,
the nature of engagements and work assignments might differ and, consequently, different types
of threats might be created.

120.6 A3

Threats to compliance with the fundamental principles fall into one or more of the following
categories:

120.6 A4

(a)

Self-interest threat – the threat that a financial or other interest will inappropriately influence
a professional accountant’s judgement or behaviour;

(b)

Self-review threat – the threat that a professional accountant will not appropriately evaluate
the results of a previous judgement made, or an activity performed by the accountant or
by another individual within the accountant’s firm or employing organisation, on which the
accountant will rely when forming a judgement as part of performing a current activity;

(c)

Advocacy threat – the threat that a professional accountant will promote a client’s or
employing organisation’s position to the point that the accountant’s objectivity is
compromised;

(d)

Familiarity threat – the threat that due to a long or close relationship with a client, or
employing organisation, a professional accountant will be too sympathetic to their interests
or too accepting of their work; and

(e)

Intimidation threat – the threat that a professional accountant will be deterred from acting
objectively because of actual or perceived pressures, including attempts to exercise undue
influence over the accountant.

A circumstance might create more than one threat, and a threat might affect compliance with
more than one fundamental principle.

Evaluating Threats
R120.7

When the professional accountant identifies a threat to compliance with the fundamental
principles, the accountant shall evaluate whether such a threat is at an acceptable level.

Acceptable level
120.7 A1

An acceptable level is a level at which a professional accountant using the reasonable and
informed third party test would likely conclude that the accountant complies with the fundamental
principles.

SECTION 120 Page 22 of 226

THE CODE

Factors Relevant in Evaluating the Level of Threats
120.8 A1

The consideration of qualitative as well as quantitative factors is relevant in the professional
accountant’s evaluation of threats, as is the combined effect of multiple threats, if applicable.

120.8 A2

The existence of conditions, policies and procedures described in paragraph 120.6 A1 might also
be factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats to compliance with the fundamental
principles. Examples of such conditions, policies and procedures include:
•

Corporate governance requirements.

•

Educational, training and experience requirements for the profession.

•

Effective complaint systems which enable the professional accountant and the general
public to draw attention to unethical behaviour.

•

An explicitly stated duty to report breaches of ethics requirements.

•

Professional or regulatory monitoring and disciplinary procedures.

Consideration of New Information or Changes in Facts and Circumstances
R120.9

If the professional accountant becomes aware of new information or changes in facts and
circumstances that might impact whether a threat has been eliminated or reduced to an
acceptable level, the accountant shall re-evaluate and address that threat accordingly.

120.9 A1

Remaining alert throughout the professional activity assists the professional accountant in
determining whether new information has emerged or changes in facts and circumstances have
occurred that:

120.9 A2

(a)

Impact the level of a threat; or

(b)

Affect the accountant’s conclusions about whether safeguards applied continue to be
appropriate to address identified threats.

If new information results in the identification of a new threat, the professional accountant is
required to evaluate and, as appropriate, address this threat. (Ref: Paras. R120.7 and R120.10).

Addressing Threats
R120.10

If the professional accountant determines that the identified threats to compliance with the
fundamental principles are not at an acceptable level, the accountant shall address the threats
by eliminating them or reducing them to an acceptable level. The accountant shall do so by:
(a)

Eliminating the circumstances, including interests or relationships, that are creating the
threats;

(b)

Applying safeguards, where available and capable of being applied, to reduce the threats
to an acceptable level; or

(c)

Declining or ending the specific professional activity.

Actions to Eliminate Threats
120.10 A1

Depending on the facts and circumstances, a threat might be addressed by eliminating the
circumstance creating the threat. However, there are some situations in which threats can only be
addressed by declining or ending the specific professional activity. This is because the
circumstances that created the threats cannot be eliminated and safeguards are not capable of
being applied to reduce the threat to an acceptable level.

Safeguards
120.10 A2

Safeguards are actions, individually or in combination, that the professional accountant takes
that effectively reduce threats to compliance with the fundamental principles to an acceptable
level.

Consideration of Significant Judgements Made and Overall Conclusions Reached
R120.11

The professional accountant shall form an overall conclusion about whether the actions that the
accountant takes, or intends to take, to address the threats created will eliminate those threats or
reduce them to an acceptable level. In forming the overall conclusion, the accountant shall:
(a)

Review any significant judgements made or conclusions reached; and
SECTION 120 Page 23 of 226

THE CODE

(b)

Use the reasonable and informed third party test.

Other Considerations when Applying the Conceptual Framework
Bias
120.12 A1

Conscious or unconscious bias affects the exercise of professional judgement when identifying,
evaluating and addressing threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.

120.12 A2

Examples of potential bias to be aware of when exercising professional judgement include:

120.12 A3

•

Anchoring bias, which is a tendency to use an initial piece of information as an anchor
against which subsequent information is inadequately assessed.

•

Automation bias, which is a tendency to favour output generated from automated systems,
even when human reasoning or contradictory information raises questions as to whether
such output is reliable or fit for purpose.

•

Availability bias, which is a tendency to place more weight on events or experiences that
immediately come to mind or are readily available than on those that are not.

•

Confirmation bias, which is a tendency to place more weight on information that
corroborates an existing belief than information that contradicts or casts doubt on that
belief.

•

Groupthink, which is a tendency for a group of individuals to discourage individual creativity
and responsibility and as a result reach a decision without critical reasoning or
consideration of alternatives.

•

Overconfidence bias, which is a tendency to overestimate one’s own ability to make
accurate assessments of risk or other judgements or decisions.

•

Representation bias, which is a tendency to base an understanding on a pattern of
experiences, events or beliefs that is assumed to be representative.

•

Selective perception, which is a tendency for a person’s expectations to influence how the
person views a particular matter or person.

Actions that might mitigate the effect of bias include:
•

Seeking advice from experts to obtain additional input.

•

Consulting with others to ensure appropriate challenge as part of the evaluation process.

•

Receiving training related to the identification of bias as part of professional development.

Organisational Culture
120.13 A1

The effective application of the conceptual framework by a professional accountant is enhanced
when the importance of ethical values that align with the fundamental principles and other
provisions set out in the Code is promoted through the internal culture of the accountant’s
organisation.

120.13 A2

The promotion of an ethical culture within an organisation is most effective when:

120.13 A3

(a)

Leaders and those in managerial roles promote the importance of, and hold themselves
and others accountable for demonstrating, the ethical values of the organisation;

(b)

Appropriate education and training programmes, management processes, and
performance evaluation and reward criteria that promote an ethical culture are in place;

(c)

Effective policies and procedures are in place to encourage and protect those who report
actual or suspected illegal or unethical behaviour, including whistle-blowers; and

(d)

The organisation adheres to ethical values in its dealings with third parties.

Professional accountants are expected to:
(a)

Encourage and promote an ethics-based culture in their organisation, taking into account
their position and seniority; and

(b)

Exhibit ethical behaviour in dealings with individuals with whom, and entities with which,
the accountants, the firm or the employing organisation has a professional or business
relationship.
SECTION 120 Page 24 of 226

THE CODE

Considerations for Audits, Reviews, Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements
Firm Culture
120.14 A1

ISQM 1 sets out requirements and application material relating to firm culture in the context of a
firm’s responsibilities to design, implement and operate a system of quality management for
audits or reviews of financial statements, or other assurance or related services engagements.

Independence
120. 15 A1

Professional accountants in public practice are required by International Independence
Standards to be independent when performing audits, reviews, or other assurance engagements.
Independence is linked to the fundamental principles of objectivity and integrity. It comprises:
(a)

Independence of mind – the state of mind that permits the expression of a conclusion
without being affected by influences that compromise professional judgement, thereby
allowing an individual to act with integrity, and exercise objectivity and professional
scepticism.

(b)

Independence in appearance – the avoidance of facts and circumstances that are so
significant that a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that a
firm’s or an audit or assurance team member’s integrity, objectivity or professional
scepticism has been compromised.

120.15 A2

International Independence Standards set out requirements and application material on how to
apply the conceptual framework to maintain independence when performing audits, reviews or
other assurance engagements. Professional accountants and firms are required to comply with
these standards in order to be independent when conducting such engagements. The conceptual
framework to identify, evaluate and address threats to compliance with the fundamental
principles applies in the same way to compliance with independence requirements. The
categories of threats to compliance with the fundamental principles described in paragraph 120.6
A3 are also the categories of threats to compliance with independence requirements.

120.15 A3

Conditions, policies and procedures described in paragraphs 120.6 A1 and 120.8 A2 that might
assist in identifying and evaluating threats to compliance with the fundamental principles might
also be factors relevant to identifying and evaluating threats to independence. In the context of
audits, reviews and other assurance engagements, a system of quality management designed,
implemented and operated by a firm in accordance with the quality management standards
issued by the IAASB is an example of such conditions, policies and procedures.

Professional Scepticism
120.16 A1

Under auditing, review and other assurance standards, including those issued by the IAASB,
professional accountants in public practice are required to exercise professional scepticism when
planning and performing audits, reviews and other assurance engagements. Professional
scepticism and the fundamental principles that are described in Section 110 are inter-related
concepts.

120.16 A2

In an audit of financial statements, compliance with the fundamental principles, individually and
collectively, supports the exercise of professional scepticism, as shown in the following
examples:
•

Integrity requires the professional accountant to be straightforward and honest. For
example, the accountant complies with the principle of integrity by:
o

Being straightforward and honest when raising concerns about a position taken by
a client.

o

Pursuing inquiries about inconsistent information and seeking further audit evidence
to address concerns about statements that might be materially false or misleading
in order to make informed decisions about the appropriate course of action in the
circumstances.

o

Having the strength of character to act appropriately, even when facing pressure to
do otherwise or when doing so might create potential adverse personal or
organisational consequences. Acting appropriately involves:
(a)

Standing one’s ground when confronted by dilemmas and difficult situations;
or
SECTION 120 Page 25 of 226

THE CODE

(b)

Challenging others as and when circumstances warrant,

in a manner appropriate to the circumstances.
In doing so, the accountant demonstrates the critical assessment of audit evidence that
contributes to the exercise of professional scepticism.
•

Objectivity requires the professional accountant to exercise professional or business
judgement without being compromised by:
(a)

Bias;

(b)

Conflict of interest; or

(c)

Undue influence of, or undue reliance on, individuals, organisations, technology or
other factors.

For example, the accountant complies with the principle of objectivity by:
(a)

Recognising circumstances or relationships such as familiarity with the client, that
might compromise the accountant’s professional or business judgement; and

(b)

Considering the impact of such circumstances and relationships on the accountant’s
judgement when evaluating the sufficiency and appropriateness of audit evidence
related to a matter material to the client’s financial statements.

In doing so, the accountant behaves in a manner that contributes to the exercise of
professional scepticism.
•

Professional competence and due care requires the professional accountant to have
professional knowledge and skill at the level required to ensure the provision of competent
professional service, and to act diligently in accordance with applicable standards, laws and
regulations. For example, the accountant complies with the principle of professional
competence and due care by:
(a)

Applying knowledge that is relevant to a particular client’s industry and business
activities in order to properly identify risks of material misstatement;

(b)

Designing and performing appropriate audit procedures; and

(c)

Applying relevant knowledge when critically assessing whether audit evidence is
sufficient and appropriate in the circumstances.

In doing so, the accountant behaves in a manner that contributes to the exercise of
professional scepticism.

PART 2 - PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN BUSINESS
SECTION 200
APPLYING THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK – PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN
BUSINESS
Introduction
200.1

This Part of the Code sets out requirements and application material for professional accountants in
business when applying the conceptual framework set out in Section 120. It does not describe all of
the facts and circumstances, including professional activities, interests and relationships, that could
be encountered by professional accountants in business, which create or might create threats to
compliance with the fundamental principles. Therefore, the conceptual framework requires
professional accountants in business to be alert for such facts and circumstances.

200.2

Investors, creditors, employing organisations and other sectors of the business community, as
well as governments and the general public, might rely on the work of professional accountants
in business. professional accountants in business might be solely or jointly responsible for the
preparation and reporting of financial and other information, on which both their employing
organisations and third parties might rely. They might also be responsible for providing effective
financial management and competent advice on a variety of business-related matters.

200.3

A professional accountant in business might be an employee, contractor, partner, director
(executive or non-executive), owner-manager, or volunteer of an employing organisation. The
legal form of the relationship of the accountant with the employing organisation has no bearing
on the ethical responsibilities placed on the accountant.

200.4

In this Part, the term “professional accountant” refers to:
(a)

A professional accountant in business; and

(b)

An individual who is a professional accountant in public practice when performing
professional activities pursuant to the accountant’s relationship with the accountant’s firm,
whether as a contractor, employee or owner. More information on when Part 2 is applicable
to professional accountants in public practice is set out in paragraphs R120.4, R300.5 and
300.5 A1.

Requirements and Application Material
General
R200.5

A professional accountant shall comply with the fundamental principles set out in Section 110
and apply the conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address
threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.

200.5 A1

A professional accountant has a responsibility to further the legitimate objectives of the
accountant’s employing organisation. The Code does not seek to hinder accountants from
fulfilling that responsibility, but addresses circumstances in which compliance with the
fundamental principles might be compromised.

200.5 A2

Professional accountants may promote the position of the employing organisation when
furthering the legitimate goals and objectives of their employing organisation, provided that any
statements made are neither false nor misleading. Such actions usually would not create an
advocacy threat.

200.5 A3

The more senior the position of a professional accountant, the greater will be the ability and
opportunity to access information, and to influence policies, decisions made and actions taken
by others involved with the employing organisation. To the extent that they are able to do so,
taking into account their position and seniority in the organisation, accountants are expected to
encourage and promote an ethics-based culture in the organisation and exhibit ethical behaviour
in dealings with individuals with whom, and entities with which, the accountant or the employing
organisation has a professional or business relationship in accordance with paragraph 120.13
A3. Examples of actions that might be taken include the introduction, implementation and
oversight of:
•

Ethics education and training programmes.

SECTION 200 Page 28 of 226

THE CODE

•

Management processes and performance evaluation and reward criteria that promote an
ethical culture.

•

Ethics and whistle-blowing policies.

•

Policies and procedures designed to prevent non-compliance with laws and regulations.

Identifying Threats
200.6 A1

Threats to compliance with the fundamental principles might be created by a broad range of facts
and circumstances. The categories of threats are described in paragraph 120.6 A3. The following
are examples of facts and circumstances within each of those categories that might create threats
for a professional accountant when undertaking a professional activity:
(a)

(b)

Self-interest Threats
•

A professional accountant holding a financial interest in, or receiving a loan or
guarantee from, the employing organisation.

•

A professional accountant participating in incentive compensation arrangements
offered by the employing organisation.

•

A professional accountant having access to corporate assets for personal use.

•

A professional accountant being offered a gift or special treatment from a supplier of
the employing organisation.

Self-review Threats
•

(c)

Advocacy Threats
•

(d)

(e)

A professional accountant determining the appropriate accounting treatment for a
business combination after performing the feasibility study supporting the purchase
decision.

A professional accountant having the opportunity to manipulate information in a
prospectus in order to obtain favourable financing.

Familiarity Threats
•

A professional accountant being responsible for the financial reporting of the
employing organisation when an immediate or close family member employed by
the organisation makes decisions that affect the financial reporting of the
organisation.

•

A professional accountant having a long association with individuals influencing
business decisions.

Intimidation Threats
•

•

A professional accountant or immediate or close family member facing the threat of
dismissal or replacement over a disagreement about:
o

The application of an accounting principle.

o

The way in which financial information is to be reported.

An individual attempting to influence the decision-making process of the professional
accountant, for example with regard to the awarding of contracts or the application
of an accounting principle.

Identifying Threats Associated with the Use of Technology
200.6 A2

The following are examples of facts and circumstances relating to the use of technology that
might create threats for a professional accountant when undertaking a professional activity:
•

Self-interest Threats
o
The data available might not be sufficient for the effective use of the technology.
o
The technology might not be appropriate for the purpose for which it is to be used.

SECTION 200 Page 29 of 226

THE CODE

o

The accountant might not have sufficient information and expertise, or access to an
expert with sufficient understanding, to use and explain the technology and its
appropriateness for the purpose intended.

(Ref: Para. 230.2).
•

Self-review Threats
o

The technology was designed or developed using the knowledge, expertise or
judgement of the accountant or employing organisation.

Evaluating Threats
200.7 A1

The conditions, policies and procedures described in paragraphs 120.6 A1 and 120.8 A2 might
impact the evaluation of whether a threat to compliance with the fundamental principles is at an
acceptable level.

200.7 A2

The professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat is also impacted by the nature
and scope of the professional activity.

200.7 A3

The professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat might be impacted by the work
environment within the employing organisation and its operating environment. For example:

200.7 A4

200.7 A5

•

Leadership that stresses the importance of ethical behaviour and the expectation that
employees will act in an ethical manner.

•

Policies and procedures to empower and encourage employees to communicate ethics
issues that concern them to senior levels of management without fear of retribution.

•

Policies and procedures to implement and monitor the quality of employee performance.

•

Systems of corporate oversight or other oversight structures and strong internal controls.

•

Recruitment procedures emphasising the importance of employing high calibre competent
personnel.

•

Timely communication of policies and procedures, including any changes to them, to all
employees, and appropriate training and education on such policies and procedures.

•

Ethics and code of conduct policies.

The professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat associated with the use of
technology might also be impacted by the work environment within the employing organisation
and its operating environment. For example:
•

Level of corporate oversight and internal controls over the technology.

•

Assessments of the quality and functionality of technology that are undertaken by a thirdparty.

•

Training that is provided regularly to all relevant employees so they obtain and maintain
the professional competence to sufficiently understand, use and explain the technology
and its appropriateness for the purpose intended.

Professional accountants might consider obtaining legal advice where they believe that unethical
behaviour or actions by others have occurred, or will continue to occur, within the employing
organisation.

Addressing Threats
200.8 A1

Sections 210 to 270 describe certain threats that might arise during the course of performing
professional activities and include examples of actions that might address such threats.

200.8 A2

In extreme situations, if the circumstances that created the threats cannot be eliminated and
safeguards are not available or capable of being applied to reduce the threat to an acceptable
level, it might be appropriate for a professional accountant to resign from the employing
organisation.

Communicating with Those Charged with Governance
R200.9

When communicating with those charged with governance in accordance with the Code, a
professional accountant shall determine the appropriate individual(s) within the employing
SECTION 200 Page 30 of 226

THE CODE

organisation’s governance structure with whom to communicate. If the accountant communicates
with a subgroup of those charged with governance, the accountant shall determine whether
communication with all of those charged with governance is also necessary so that they are
adequately informed.
200.9 A1

In determining with whom to communicate, a professional accountant might consider:
(a)

The nature and importance of the circumstances; and

(b)

The matter to be communicated.

200.9 A2

Examples of a subgroup of those charged with governance include an audit committee or an
individual member of those charged with governance.

R200.10

If a professional accountant communicates with individuals who have management
responsibilities as well as governance responsibilities, the accountant shall be satisfied that
communication with those individuals adequately informs all of those in a governance role with
whom the accountant would otherwise communicate.

200.10 A1

In some circumstances, all of those charged with governance are involved in managing the
employing organisation, for example, a small business where a single owner manages the
organisation and no one else has a governance role. In these cases, if matters are communicated
with individual(s) with management responsibilities, and those individual(s) also have
governance responsibilities, the professional accountant has satisfied the requirement to
communicate with those charged with governance.

SECTION 200 Page 31 of 226

THE CODE

SECTION 210
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Introduction
210.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

210.2

A conflict of interest creates threats to compliance with the principle of objectivity and might create
threats to compliance with the other fundamental principles. Such threats might be created when:
(a)

A professional accountant undertakes a professional activity related to a particular matter
for two or more parties whose interests with respect to that matter are in conflict; or

(b)

The interest of a professional accountant with respect to a particular matter and the
interests of a party for whom the accountant undertakes a professional activity related to
that matter are in conflict.

A party might include an employing organisation, a vendor, a customer, a lender, a shareholder,
or another party.
210.3

This section sets out specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the
conceptual framework to conflicts of interest.

Requirements and Application Material
General
R210.4

A professional accountant shall not allow a conflict of interest to compromise professional or
business judgement.

210.4 A1

Examples of circumstances that might create a conflict of interest include:
•

Serving in a management or governance position for two employing organisations and
acquiring confidential information from one organisation that might be used by the
professional accountant to the advantage or disadvantage of the other organisation.

•

Undertaking a professional activity for each of two parties in a partnership, where both
parties are employing the accountant to assist them to dissolve their partnership.

•

Preparing financial information for certain members of management of the accountant’s
employing organisation who are seeking to undertake a management buy-out.

•

Being responsible for selecting a vendor for the employing organisation when an
immediate family member of the accountant might benefit financially from the transaction.

•

Serving in a governance capacity in an employing organisation that is approving certain
investments for the company where one of those investments will increase the value of the
investment portfolio of the accountant or an immediate family member.

Conflict Identification
R210.5

R210.6

A professional accountant shall take reasonable steps to identify circumstances that might create
a conflict of interest, and therefore a threat to compliance with one or more of the fundamental
principles. Such steps shall include identifying:
(a)

The nature of the relevant interests and relationships between the parties involved; and

(b)

The activity and its implication for relevant parties.

A professional accountant shall remain alert to changes over time in the nature of the activities,
interests and relationships that might create a conflict of interest while performing a professional
activity.

Threats Created by Conflicts of Interest
210.7 A1

In general, the more direct the connection between the professional activity and the matter on
which the parties’ interests conflict, the more likely the level of the threat is not at an acceptable
level.

210.7 A2

An example of an action that might eliminate threats created by conflicts of interest is withdrawing
from the decision-making process related to the matter giving rise to the conflict of interest.
SECTION 210 Page 32 of 226

THE CODE

210.7 A3

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address threats created by conflicts of interest
include:
•

Restructuring or segregating certain responsibilities and duties.

•

Obtaining appropriate oversight, for example, acting under the supervision of an executive
or non-executive director.

Disclosure and Consent
General
210.8 A1

It is generally necessary to:
(a)

Disclose the nature of the conflict of interest and how any threats created were addressed
to the relevant parties, including to the appropriate levels within the employing organisation
affected by a conflict; and

(b)

Obtain consent from the relevant parties for the professional accountant to undertake the
professional activity when safeguards are applied to address the threat.

210.8 A2

Consent might be implied by a party’s conduct in circumstances where the professional
accountant has sufficient evidence to conclude that the parties know the circumstances at the
outset and have accepted the conflict of interest if they do not raise an objection to the existence
of the conflict.

210.8 A3

If such disclosure or consent is not in writing, the professional accountant is encouraged to
document:
(a)

The nature of the circumstances giving rise to the conflict of interest;

(b)

The safeguards applied to address the threats when applicable; and

(c)

The consent obtained.

Other Considerations
210.9 A1

When addressing a conflict of interest, the professional accountant is encouraged to seek
guidance from within the employing organisation or from others, such as a professional body,
legal counsel or another accountant. When making such disclosures or sharing information within
the employing organisation and seeking guidance of third parties, the principle of confidentiality
applies.

THE CODE

SECTION 220
PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION
Introduction
220.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

220.2

Preparing or presenting information might create a self-interest, intimidation or other threats to
compliance with one or more of the fundamental principles. This section sets out specific
requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such
circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
General
220.3 A1

Professional accountants at all levels in an employing organisation are involved in the
preparation or presentation of information both within and outside the organisation.

220.3 A2

Stakeholders to whom, or for whom, such information is prepared or presented, include:
•

Management and those charged with governance.

•

Investors and lenders or other creditors.

•

Regulatory bodies.

This information might assist stakeholders in understanding and evaluating aspects of the
employing organisation’s state of affairs and in making decisions concerning the organisation.
Information can include financial and non-financial information that might be made public or used
for internal purposes.
Examples include:
•

Operating and performance reports.

•

Decision support analyses.

•

Budgets and forecasts.

•

Information provided to the internal and external auditors.

•

Risk analyses.

•

General and special purpose financial statements.

•

Tax returns.

•

Reports filed with regulatory bodies for legal and compliance purposes.

220.3 A3

For the purposes of this section, preparing or presenting information includes recording,
maintaining and approving information.

R220.4

When preparing or presenting information, a professional accountant shall:
(a)

Prepare or present the information in accordance with a relevant reporting framework,
where applicable;

(b)

Prepare or present the information in a manner that is intended neither to mislead nor to
influence contractual or regulatory outcomes inappropriately;

(c)

Exercise professional judgement to:

(d)

(i)

Represent the facts accurately and completely in all material respects;

(ii)

Describe clearly the true nature of business transactions or activities; and

(iii)

Classify and record information in a timely and proper manner;

Not omit anything with the intention of rendering the information misleading or of
influencing contractual or regulatory outcomes inappropriately;

SECTION 220 Page 34 of 226

THE CODE

220.4 A1

(e)

Avoid undue influence of, or undue reliance on, individuals, organisations or technology;
and

(f)

Be aware of the risk of bias.

An example of influencing a contractual or regulatory outcome inappropriately is using an
unrealistic estimate with the intention of avoiding violation of a contractual requirement such as
a debt covenant or of a regulatory requirement such as a capital requirement for a financial
institution.

Use of Discretion in Preparing or Presenting Information
R220.5

Preparing or presenting information might require the exercise of discretion in making
professional judgements. The professional accountant shall not exercise such discretion with the
intention of misleading others or influencing contractual or regulatory outcomes inappropriately.

220.5 A1

Examples of ways in which discretion might be misused to achieve inappropriate outcomes
include:

R220.6

•

Determining estimates, for example, determining fair value estimates in order to
misrepresent profit or loss.

•

Selecting or changing an accounting policy or method among two or more alternatives
permitted under the applicable financial reporting framework, for example, selecting a
policy for accounting for long-term contracts in order to misrepresent profit or loss.

•

Determining the timing of transactions, for example, timing the sale of an asset near the
end of the fiscal year in order to mislead.

•

Determining the structuring of transactions, for example, structuring financing transactions
in order to misrepresent assets and liabilities or classification of cash flows.

•

Selecting disclosures, for example, omitting or obscuring information relating to financial
or operating risk in order to mislead.

When performing professional activities, especially those that do not require compliance with a
relevant reporting framework, the professional accountant shall exercise professional judgement
to identify and consider:
(a)

The purpose for which the information is to be used;

(b)

The context within which it is given; and

(c)

The audience to whom it is addressed.

220.6 A1

For example, when preparing or presenting pro forma reports, budgets or forecasts, the inclusion
of relevant estimates, approximations and assumptions, where appropriate, would enable those
who might rely on such information to form their own judgements.

220.6 A2

The professional accountant might also consider clarifying the intended audience, context and
purpose of the information to be presented.

Using the Work of Others
R220.7

A professional accountant who intends to use the work of others, whether internal or external to
the employing organisation, or other organisations, shall exercise professional judgement to
determine the appropriate steps to take, if any, in order to fulfil the responsibilities set out in
paragraph R220.4.

220.7 A1

Factors to consider when a professional accountant intends to use the work of others include:
•

The reputation and expertise of, and resources available to, the other individual or
organisation.

•

Whether the other individual is subject to applicable professional and ethics standards.

Such information might be gained from prior association with, or from consulting others about,
the other individual or organisation.

SECTION 220 Page 35 of 226

THE CODE

Using the Output of Technology
R220.8

A professional accountant who intends to use the output of technology, whether that technology
was developed internally or provided by third parties, shall exercise professional judgement to
determine the appropriate steps to take, if any, in order to fulfil the responsibilities set out in
paragraph R220.4.

220.8 A1

Factors to consider when a professional accountant intends to use the output of technology
include:
•

The nature of the activity to be performed by the technology.

•

The expected use of, or extent of reliance on, the output of the technology.

•

Whether the accountant has the ability, or has access to an expert with the ability, to
understand, use and explain the technology and its appropriateness for the purpose
intended.

•

Whether the technology used has been appropriately tested and evaluated for the purpose
intended.

•

Prior experience with the technology and whether its use for specific purposes is generally
accepted.

•

The employing organisation’s oversight of the design, development, implementation,
operation, maintenance, monitoring, updating or upgrading of the technology.

•

The controls relating to the use of the technology, including procedures for authorising user
access to the technology and overseeing such use.

•

The appropriateness of the inputs to the technology, including data and any related
decisions, and decisions made by individuals in the course of using the technology.

Addressing Information that Is or Might be Misleading
R220.9

When the professional accountant knows or has reason to believe that the information with which
the accountant is associated is misleading, the accountant shall take appropriate actions to seek
to resolve the matter.

220.9 A1

Actions that might be appropriate include:
•

•
220.9 A2

Discussing concerns that the information is misleading with the professional accountant’s
superior and/or the appropriate level(s) of management within the accountant’s employing
organisation or those charged with governance, and requesting such individuals to take
appropriate action to resolve the matter. Such action might include:
o

Having the information corrected.

o

If the information has already been disclosed to the intended users, informing them
of the correct information.

Consulting the policies and procedures of the employing organisation (for example, an
ethics or whistle-blowing policy) regarding how to address such matters internally.

The professional accountant might determine that the employing organisation has not taken
appropriate action. If the accountant continues to have reason to believe that the information is
misleading, the following further actions might be appropriate provided that the accountant
remains alert to the principle of confidentiality:
•

•

Consulting with:
o

A relevant professional body.

o

The internal or external auditor of the employing organisation.

o

Legal counsel.

Determining whether any requirements exist to communicate to:
o

Third parties, including users of the information.

o

Regulatory and oversight authorities.
SECTION 220 Page 36 of 226

THE CODE

R220.10

If after exhausting all feasible options, the professional accountant determines that appropriate
action has not been taken and there is reason to believe that the information is still misleading,
the accountant shall refuse to be or to remain associated with the information.

220.10 A1

In such circumstances, it might be appropriate for a professional accountant to resign from the
employing organisation.

Documentation
220.11 A1

The professional accountant is encouraged to document:
•

The facts.

•

The accounting principles or other relevant professional standards involved.

•

The communications and parties with whom matters were discussed.

•

The courses of action considered.

•

How the accountant attempted to address the matter(s).

Other Considerations
220.12 A1

Where threats to compliance with the fundamental principles relating to the preparation or
presentation of information arise from a financial interest, including compensation and incentives
linked to financial reporting and decision making, the requirements and application material set
out in Section 240 apply.

220.12 A2

Where the misleading information might involve non-compliance with laws and regulations, the
requirements and application material set out in Section 260 apply.

220.12 A3

Where threats to compliance with the fundamental principles relating to the preparation or
presentation of information arise from pressure, the requirements and application material set
out in Section 270 apply.

220.12 A4

When a professional accountant is considering using the work of others or the output of
technology, a consideration is whether the accountant is in a position within the employing
organisation to obtain information in relation to the factors necessary to determine whether such
use is appropriate.

SECTION 230
ACTING WITH SUFFICIENT EXPERTISE
Introduction
230.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

230.2

Acting without sufficient expertise creates a self-interest threat to compliance with the principle
of professional competence and due care. This section sets out specific requirements and
application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
General
R230.3

A professional accountant shall not intentionally mislead an employing organisation as to the
level of expertise or experience possessed.

230.3 A1

The principle of professional competence and due care requires that a professional accountant
only undertake significant tasks for which the accountant has, or can obtain, sufficient training or
experience.

230.3 A2

A self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional competence and due care
might be created if a professional accountant has:

230.3 A3

230.3 A4

R230.4

•

Insufficient time for performing or completing the relevant duties.

•

Incomplete, restricted or otherwise inadequate information for performing the duties.

•

Insufficient experience, training and/or education.

•

Inadequate resources for the performance of the duties.

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:
•

The extent to which the professional accountant is working with others.

•

The relative seniority of the accountant in the business.

•

The level of supervision and review applied to the work.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:
•

Obtaining assistance or training from someone with the necessary expertise.

•

Ensuring that there is adequate time available for performing the relevant duties.

If a threat to compliance with the principle of professional competence and due care cannot be
addressed, a professional accountant shall determine whether to decline to perform the duties
in question. If the accountant determines that declining is appropriate, the accountant shall
communicate the reasons.

Other Considerations
230.5 A1

The requirements and application material in Section 270 apply when a professional accountant
is pressured to act in a manner that might lead to a breach of the principle of professional
competence and due care.

SECTION 240
FINANCIAL INTERESTS, COMPENSATION AND INCENTIVES LINKED TO FINANCIAL
REPORTING AND DECISION MAKING
Introduction
240.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

240.2

Having a financial interest, or knowing of a financial interest held by an immediate or close family
member might create a self-interest threat to compliance with the principles of objectivity or
confidentiality. This section sets out specific requirements and application material relevant to
applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
General
R240.3

A professional accountant shall not manipulate information or use confidential information for
personal gain or for the financial gain of others.

240.3 A1

Professional accountants might have financial interests or might know of financial interests of
immediate or close family members that, in certain circumstances, might create threats to
compliance with the fundamental principles. Financial interests include those arising from
compensation or incentive arrangements linked to financial reporting and decision making.

240.3 A2

Examples of circumstances that might create a self-interest threat include situations in which the
professional accountant or an immediate or close family member:

240.3 A3

•

Has a motive and opportunity to manipulate price-sensitive information in order to gain
financially.

•

Holds a direct or indirect financial interest in the employing organisation and the value of
that financial interest might be directly affected by decisions made by the accountant.

•

Is eligible for a profit-related bonus and the value of that bonus might be directly affected
by decisions made by the accountant.

•

Holds, directly or indirectly, deferred bonus share rights or share options in the employing
organisation, the value of which might be affected by decisions made by the accountant.

•

Participates in compensation arrangements which provide incentives to achieve targets or
to support efforts to maximise the value of the employing organisation’s shares. An
example of such an arrangement might be through participation in incentive plans which
are linked to certain performance conditions being met.

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:
•

The significance of the financial interest. What constitutes a significant financial interest
will depend on personal circumstances and the materiality of the financial interest to the
individual.

•

Policies and procedures for a committee independent of management to determine the
level or form of senior management remuneration.

•

In accordance with any internal policies, disclosure to those charged with governance of:

•
240.3 A4

o

All relevant interests.

o

Any plans to exercise entitlements or trade in relevant shares.

Internal and external audit procedures that are specific to address issues that give rise to
the financial interest.

Threats created by compensation or incentive arrangements might be compounded by explicit or
implicit pressure from superiors or colleagues. See Section 270, Pressure to Breach the
Fundamental Principles.

SECTION 250
INDUCEMENTS, INCLUDING GIFTS AND HOSPITALITY
Introduction
250.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

250.2

Offering or accepting inducements might create a self-interest, familiarity or intimidation threat to
compliance with the fundamental principles, particularly the principles of integrity, objectivity and
professional behaviour.

250.3

This section sets out requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual
framework in relation to the offering and accepting of inducements when undertaking
professional activities that does not constitute non-compliance with laws and regulations. This
section also requires a professional accountant to comply with relevant laws and regulations
when offering or accepting inducements.

Requirements and Application Material
General
250.4 A1

An inducement is an object, situation, or action that is used as a means to influence another
individual’s behaviour, but not necessarily with the intent to improperly influence that individual’s
behaviour. Inducements can range from minor acts of hospitality between business colleagues
to acts that result in non-compliance with laws and regulations. An inducement can take many
different forms, for example:
•

Gifts.

•

Hospitality.

•

Entertainment.

•

Political or charitable donations.

•

Appeals to friendship and loyalty.

•

Employment or other commercial opportunities.

•

Preferential treatment, rights or privileges.

Inducements Prohibited by Laws and Regulations
R250.5

In many jurisdictions, there are laws and regulations, such as those related to bribery and
corruption, that prohibit the offering or accepting of inducements in certain circumstances. The
professional accountant shall obtain an understanding of relevant laws and regulations and
comply with them when the accountant encounters such circumstances.

Inducements Not Prohibited by Laws and Regulations
250.6 A1

The offering or accepting of inducements that is not prohibited by laws and regulations might still
create threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.

Inducements with Intent to Improperly Influence Behaviour
R250.7

A professional accountant shall not offer, or encourage others to offer, any inducement that is
made, or which the accountant considers a reasonable and informed third party would be likely
to conclude is made, with the intent to improperly influence the behaviour of the recipient or of
another individual.

R250.8

A professional accountant shall not accept, or encourage others to accept, any inducement that
the accountant concludes is made, or considers a reasonable and informed third party would be
likely to conclude is made, with the intent to improperly influence the behaviour of the recipient
or of another individual.

250.9 A1

An inducement is considered as improperly influencing an individual’s behaviour if it causes the
individual to act in an unethical manner. Such improper influence can be directed either towards
the recipient or towards another individual who has some relationship with the recipient. The
fundamental principles are an appropriate frame of reference for a professional accountant in
SECTION 250 Page 40 of 226

THE CODE

considering what constitutes unethical behaviour on the part of the accountant and, if necessary
by analogy, other individuals.
250.9 A2

A breach of the fundamental principle of integrity arises when a professional accountant offers
or accepts, or encourages others to offer or accept, an inducement where the intent is to
improperly influence the behaviour of the recipient or of another individual.

250.9 A3

The determination of whether there is actual or perceived intent to improperly influence behaviour
requires the exercise of professional judgement. Relevant factors to consider might include:
•

The nature, frequency, value and cumulative effect of the inducement.

•

Timing of when the inducement is offered relative to any action or decision that it might
influence.

•

Whether the inducement is a customary or cultural practice in the circumstances, for
example, offering a gift on the occasion of a religious holiday or wedding.

•

Whether the inducement is an ancillary part of a professional activity, for example, offering
or accepting lunch in connection with a business meeting.

•

Whether the offer of the inducement is limited to an individual recipient or available to a
broader group. The broader group might be internal or external to the employing
organisation, such as other customers or vendors.

•

The roles and positions of the individuals offering or being offered the inducement.

•

Whether the professional accountant knows, or has reason to believe, that accepting the
inducement would breach the policies and procedures of the counterparty’s employing
organisation.

•

The degree of transparency with which the inducement is offered.

•

Whether the inducement was required or requested by the recipient.

•

The known previous behaviour or reputation of the offeror.

Consideration of Further Actions
250.10 A1

If the professional accountant becomes aware of an inducement offered with actual or perceived
intent to improperly influence behaviour, threats to compliance with the fundamental principles
might still be created even if the requirements in paragraphs R250.7 and R250.8 are met.

250.10 A2

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:
•

Informing senior management or those charged with governance of the employing
organisation of the professional accountant or the offeror regarding the offer.

•

Amending or terminating the business relationship with the offeror.

Inducements with No Intent to Improperly Influence Behaviour
250.11 A1

The requirements and application material set out in the conceptual framework apply when a
professional accountant has concluded there is no actual or perceived intent to improperly
influence the behaviour of the recipient or of another individual.

250.11 A2

If such an inducement is trivial and inconsequential, any threats created will be at an acceptable
level.

250.11 A3

Examples of circumstances where offering or accepting such an inducement might create threats
even if the professional accountant has concluded there is no actual or perceived intent to
improperly influence behaviour include:
•

Self-interest threats
o

•

Familiarity threats
o

•

A professional accountant is offered part-time employment by a vendor.

A professional accountant regularly takes a customer or supplier to sporting events.

Intimidation threats

SECTION 250 Page 41 of 226

THE CODE

o

A professional accountant accepts hospitality, the nature of which could be
perceived to be inappropriate were it to be publicly disclosed.

250.11 A4

Relevant factors in evaluating the level of such threats created by offering or accepting such an
inducement include the same factors set out in paragraph 250.9 A3 for determining intent.

250.11 A5

Examples of actions that might eliminate threats created by offering or accepting such an
inducement include:

250.11 A6

•

Declining or not offering the inducement.

•

Transferring responsibility for any business-related decision involving the counterparty to
another individual who the professional accountant has no reason to believe would be, or
would be perceived to be, improperly influenced in making the decision.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats created by offering or
accepting such an inducement include:
•

Being transparent with senior management or those charged with governance of the
employing organisation of the professional accountant or of the counterparty about offering
or accepting an inducement.

•

Registering the inducement in a log maintained by the employing organisation of the
accountant or the counterparty.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer, who is not otherwise involved in undertaking the
professional activity, review any work performed or decisions made by the accountant with
respect to the individual or organisation from which the accountant accepted the
inducement.

•

Donating the inducement to charity after receipt and appropriately disclosing the donation,
for example, to those charged with governance or the individual who offered the
inducement.

•

Reimbursing the cost of the inducement, such as hospitality, received.

•

As soon as possible, returning the inducement, such as a gift, after it was initially accepted.

Immediate or Close Family Members
R250.12

A professional accountant shall remain alert to potential threats to the accountant’s compliance
with the fundamental principles created by the offering of an inducement:
(a)

By an immediate or close family member of the accountant to a counterparty with whom
the accountant has a professional relationship; or

(b)

To an immediate or close family member of the accountant by a counterparty with whom
the accountant has a professional relationship.

R250.13

Where the professional accountant becomes aware of an inducement being offered to or made
by an immediate or close family member and concludes there is intent to improperly influence
the behaviour of the accountant or of the counterparty, or considers a reasonable and informed
third party would be likely to conclude such intent exists, the accountant shall advise the
immediate or close family member not to offer or accept the inducement.

250.13 A1

The factors set out in paragraph 250.9 A3 are relevant in determining whether there is actual or
perceived intent to improperly influence the behaviour of the professional accountant or of the
counterparty. Another factor that is relevant is the nature or closeness of the relationship,
between:
(a)

The accountant and the immediate or close family member;

(b)

The immediate or close family member and the counterparty; and

(c)

The accountant and the counterparty.

For example, the offer of employment, outside of the normal recruitment process, to the spouse
of the accountant by a counterparty with whom the accountant is negotiating a significant contract
might indicate such intent.

SECTION 250 Page 42 of 226

THE CODE

250.13 A2

The application material in paragraph 250.10 A2 is also relevant in addressing threats that might
be created when there is actual or perceived intent to improperly influence the behaviour of the
professional accountant or of the counterparty even if the immediate or close family member has
followed the advice given pursuant to paragraph R250.13.

Application of the Conceptual Framework
250.14 A1

250.14 A2

Where the professional accountant becomes aware of an inducement offered in the
circumstances addressed in paragraph R250.12, threats to compliance with the fundamental
principles might be created where:
(a)

The immediate or close family member offers or accepts the inducement contrary to the
advice of the accountant pursuant to paragraph R250.13; or

(b)

The accountant does not have reason to believe an actual or perceived intent to improperly
influence the behaviour of the accountant or of the counterparty exists.

The application material in paragraphs 250.11 A1 to 250.11 A6 is relevant for the purposes of
identifying, evaluating and addressing such threats. Factors that are relevant in evaluating the
level of threats in these circumstances also include the nature or closeness of the relationships
set out in paragraph 250.13 A1.

Other Considerations
250.15 A1

If a professional accountant is offered an inducement by the employing organisation relating to
financial interests, compensation and incentives linked to performance, the requirements and
application material set out in Section 240 apply.

250.15 A2

If a professional accountant encounters or is made aware of inducements that might result in
non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations by other individuals
working for or under the direction of the employing organisation, the requirements and application
material set out in Section 260 apply.

250.15 A3

If a professional accountant faces pressure to offer or accept inducements that might create
threats to compliance with the fundamental principles, the requirements and application material
set out in Section 270 apply.

SECTION 250 Page 43 of 226

THE CODE

SECTION 260
RESPONDING TO NON-COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Introduction
260.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

260.2

A self-interest or intimidation threat to compliance with the principles of integrity and professional
behaviour is created when a professional accountant becomes aware of non-compliance or
suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations.

260.3

A professional accountant might encounter or be made aware of non-compliance or suspected
non-compliance in the course of carrying out professional activities. This section guides the
accountant in assessing the implications of the matter and the possible courses of action when
responding to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with:
(a)

Laws and regulations generally recognised to have a direct effect on the determination of
material amounts and disclosures in the employing organisation’s financial statements;
and

(b)

Other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the determination of the
amounts and disclosures in the employing organisation’s financial statements, but
compliance with which might be fundamental to the operating aspects of the employing
organisation’s business, to its ability to continue its business, or to avoid material penalties.

Objectives of the Professional Accountant in Relation to Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations
260.4

A distinguishing mark of the accountancy profession is its acceptance of the responsibility to act
in the public interest. When responding to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the
objectives of the professional accountant are:
(a)

To comply with the principles of integrity and professional behaviour;

(b)

By alerting management or, where appropriate, those charged with governance of the
employing organisation, to seek to:

(c)

(i)

Enable them to rectify, remediate or mitigate the consequences of the identified or
suspected non-compliance; or

(ii)

Deter the non-compliance where it has not yet occurred; and

To take such further action as appropriate in the public interest.

Requirements and Application Material
General
260.5 A1

260.5 A2

Non-compliance with laws and regulations (“non-compliance”) comprises acts of omission or
commission, intentional or unintentional, which are contrary to the prevailing laws or regulations
committed by the following parties:
(a)

The professional accountant’s employing organisation;

(b)

Those charged with governance of the employing organisation;

(c)

Management of the employing organisation; or

(d)

Other individuals working for or under the direction of the employing organisation.

Examples of laws and regulations which this section addresses include those that deal with:
•

Fraud, corruption and bribery.

•

Money laundering, terrorist financing and proceeds of crime.

•

Securities markets and trading.

•

Banking and other financial products and services.

•

Data protection.

•

Tax and pension liabilities and payments.
SECTION 260 Page 44 of 226

THE CODE

•

Environmental protection.

•

Public health and safety.

260.5 A3

Non-compliance might result in fines, litigation or other consequences for the employing
organisation, potentially materially affecting its financial statements. Importantly, such noncompliance might have wider public interest implications in terms of potentially substantial harm
to investors, creditors, employees or the general public. For the purposes of this section, noncompliance that causes substantial harm is one that results in serious adverse consequences to
any of these parties in financial or non-financial terms. Examples include the perpetration of a
fraud resulting in significant financial losses to investors, and breaches of environmental laws
and regulations endangering the health or safety of employees or the public.

R260.6

In some jurisdictions, there are legal or regulatory provisions governing how professional
accountants are required to address non-compliance or suspected non-compliance. These legal
or regulatory provisions might differ from or go beyond the provisions in this section. When
encountering such non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant shall obtain
an understanding of those legal or regulatory provisions and comply with them, including:
(a)

Any requirement to report the matter to an appropriate authority; and

(b)

Any prohibition on alerting the relevant party.

260.6 A1

A prohibition on alerting the relevant party might arise, for example, pursuant to anti-money
laundering legislation.

260.7 A1

This section applies regardless of the nature of the employing organisation, including whether or
not it is a public interest entity.

260.7 A2

A professional accountant who encounters or is made aware of matters that are clearly
inconsequential is not required to comply with this section. Whether a matter is clearly
inconsequential is to be judged with respect to its nature and its impact, financial or otherwise,
on the employing organisation, its stakeholders and the general public.

260.7 A3

This section does not address:
(a)

Personal misconduct unrelated to the business activities of the employing organisation;
and

(b)

Non-compliance by parties other than those specified in paragraph 260.5 A1.

The professional accountant might nevertheless find the guidance in this section helpful in
considering how to respond in these situations.
Responsibilities of the Employing Organisation’s Management and Those Charged with Governance
260.8 A1

The employing organisation’s management, with the oversight of those charged with
governance, is responsible for ensuring that the employing organisation’s business activities are
conducted in accordance with laws and regulations. Management and those charged with
governance are also responsible for identifying and addressing any non-compliance by:
(a)

The employing organisation;

(b)

An individual charged with governance of the employing organisation;

(c)

A member of management; or

(d)

Other individuals working for or under the direction of the employing organisation.

Responsibilities of All Professional Accountants
R260.9

If protocols and procedures exist within the professional accountant’s employing organisation to
address non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant shall consider them in
determining how to respond to such non-compliance.

260.9 A1

Many employing organisations have established protocols and procedures regarding how to
raise non-compliance or suspected non-compliance internally. These protocols and procedures
include, for example, an ethics policy or internal whistle-blowing mechanism. Such protocols and
procedures might allow matters to be reported anonymously through designated channels.

R260.10

Where a professional accountant becomes aware of a matter to which this section applies, the
steps that the accountant takes to comply with this section shall be taken on a timely basis. For
SECTION 260 Page 45 of 226

THE CODE

the purpose of taking timely steps, the accountant shall have regard to the nature of the matter
and the potential harm to the interests of the employing organisation, investors, creditors,
employees or the general public.
Responsibilities of Senior Professional Accountants in Business
260.11 A1

Senior professional accountants in business (“senior professional accountants”) are directors,
officers or senior employees able to exert significant influence over, and make decisions
regarding, the acquisition, deployment and control of the employing organisation’s human,
financial, technological, physical and intangible resources. There is a greater expectation for
such individuals to take whatever action is appropriate in the public interest to respond to noncompliance or suspected non-compliance than other professional accountants within the
employing organisation. This is because of senior professional accountants’ roles, positions and
spheres of influence within the employing organisation.

Obtaining an Understanding of the Matter
R260.12

If, in the course of carrying out professional activities, a senior professional accountant becomes
aware of information concerning non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant
shall obtain an understanding of the matter. This understanding shall include:
(a)

The nature of the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance and the circumstances in
which it has occurred or might occur;

(b)

The application of the relevant laws and regulations to the circumstances; and

(c)

An assessment of the potential consequences to the employing organisation, investors,
creditors, employees or the wider public.

260.12 A1

A senior professional accountant is expected to apply knowledge and expertise, and exercise
professional judgement. However, the accountant is not expected to have a level of
understanding of laws and regulations greater than that which is required for the accountant’s
role within the employing organisation. Whether an act constitutes non-compliance is ultimately
a matter to be determined by a court or other appropriate adjudicative body.

260.12 A2

Depending on the nature and significance of the matter, the senior professional accountant might
cause, or take appropriate steps to cause, the matter to be investigated internally. The
accountant might also consult on a confidential basis with others within the employing
organisation or a professional body, or with legal counsel.

Addressing the Matter
R260.13

If the senior professional accountant identifies or suspects that non-compliance has occurred or
might occur, the accountant shall, subject to paragraph R260.9, discuss the matter with the
accountant’s immediate superior, if any. If the accountant’s immediate superior appears to be
involved in the matter, the accountant shall discuss the matter with the next higher level of
authority within the employing organisation.

260.13 A1

The purpose of the discussion is to enable a determination to be made as to how to address the
matter.

R260.14

The senior professional accountant shall also take appropriate steps to:

260.14 A1

(a)

Have the matter communicated to those charged with governance;

(b)

Comply with applicable laws and regulations, including legal or regulatory provisions
governing the reporting of non-compliance or suspected non-compliance to an appropriate
authority;

(c)

Have the consequences of the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance rectified,
remediated or mitigated;

(d)

Reduce the risk of re-occurrence; and

(e)

Seek to deter the commission of the non-compliance if it has not yet occurred.

The purpose of communicating the matter to those charged with governance is to obtain their
concurrence regarding appropriate actions to take to respond to the matter and to enable them
to fulfil their responsibilities.

SECTION 260 Page 46 of 226

THE CODE

260.14 A2

Some laws and regulations might stipulate a period within which reports of non-compliance or
suspected non-compliance are to be made to an appropriate authority.

R260.15

In addition to responding to the matter in accordance with the provisions of this section, the senior
professional accountant shall determine whether disclosure of the matter to the employing
organisation’s external auditor, if any, is needed.

260.15 A1

Such disclosure would be pursuant to the senior professional accountant’s duty or legal
obligation to provide all information necessary to enable the auditor to perform the audit.

Determining Whether Further Action Is Needed
R260.16

The senior professional accountant shall assess the appropriateness of the response of the
accountant’s superiors, if any, and those charged with governance.

260.16 A1

Relevant factors to consider in assessing the appropriateness of the response of the senior
professional accountant’s superiors, if any, and those charged with governance include whether:
•

The response is timely.

•

They have taken or authorised appropriate action to seek to rectify, remediate or mitigate
the consequences of the non-compliance, or to avert the non-compliance if it has not yet
occurred.

•

The matter has been disclosed to an appropriate authority where appropriate and, if so,
whether the disclosure appears adequate.

R260.17

In light of the response of the senior professional accountant’s superiors, if any, and those
charged with governance, the accountant shall determine if further action is needed in the public
interest.

260.17 A1

The determination of whether further action is needed, and the nature and extent of it, will depend
on various factors, including:

260.17 A2

•

The legal and regulatory framework.

•

The urgency of the situation.

•

The pervasiveness of the matter throughout the employing organisation.

•

Whether the senior professional accountant continues to have confidence in the integrity
of the accountant’s superiors and those charged with governance.

•

Whether the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance is likely to recur.

•

Whether there is credible evidence of actual or potential substantial harm to the interests
of the employing organisation, investors, creditors, employees or the general public.

Examples of circumstances that might cause the senior professional accountant no longer to
have confidence in the integrity of the accountant’s superiors and those charged with governance
include situations where:
•

The accountant suspects or has evidence of their involvement or intended involvement in
any non-compliance.

•

Contrary to legal or regulatory requirements, they have not reported, or authorised the
reporting of, the matter to an appropriate authority within a reasonable period.

R260.18

The senior professional accountant shall exercise professional judgement in determining the
need for, and nature and extent of, further action. In making this determination, the accountant
shall take into account whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude
that the accountant has acted appropriately in the public interest.

260.18 A1

Further action that the senior professional accountant might take includes:
•

Informing the management of the parent entity of the matter if the employing organisation
is a member of a group.

•

Disclosing the matter to an appropriate authority even when there is no legal or regulatory
requirement to do so.

•

Resigning from the employing organisation.

SECTION 260 Page 47 of 226

THE CODE

260.18 A2

Resigning from the employing organisation is not a substitute for taking other actions that might
be needed to achieve the senior professional accountant’s objectives under this section. In some
jurisdictions, however, there might be limitations as to the further actions available to the
accountant. In such circumstances, resignation might be the only available course of action.

Seeking Advice
260.19 A1

As assessment of the matter might involve complex analysis and judgements, the senior
professional accountant might consider:
•

Consulting internally.

•

Obtaining legal advice to understand the accountant’s options and the professional or legal
implications of taking any particular course of action.

•

Consulting on a confidential basis with a regulatory or professional body.

Determining Whether to Disclose the Matter to an Appropriate Authority
260.20 A1

Disclosure of the matter to an appropriate authority would be precluded if doing so would be
contrary to law or regulation. Otherwise, the purpose of making disclosure is to enable an
appropriate authority to cause the matter to be investigated and action to be taken in the public
interest.

260.20 A2

The determination of whether to make such a disclosure depends in particular on the nature and
extent of the actual or potential harm that is or might be caused by the matter to investors,
creditors, employees or the general public. For example, the senior professional accountant
might determine that disclosure of the matter to an appropriate authority is an appropriate course
of action if:

260.20 A3

R260.21

•

The employing organisation is engaged in bribery (for example, of local or foreign
government officials for purposes of securing large contracts).

•

The employing organisation is regulated and the matter is of such significance as to
threaten its license to operate.

•

The employing organisation is listed on a securities exchange and the matter might result
in adverse consequences to the fair and orderly market in the employing organisation’s
securities or pose a systemic risk to the financial markets.

•

It is likely that the employing organisation would sell products that are harmful to public
health or safety.

•

The employing organisation is promoting a scheme to its clients to assist them in evading
taxes.

The determination of whether to make such a disclosure will also depend on external factors
such as:
•

Whether there is an appropriate authority that is able to receive the information, and cause
the matter to be investigated and action to be taken. The appropriate authority will depend
upon the nature of the matter. For example, the appropriate authority would be a securities
regulator in the case of fraudulent financial reporting or an environmental protection
agency in the case of a breach of environmental laws and regulations.

•

Whether there exists robust and credible protection from civil, criminal or professional
liability or retaliation afforded by legislation or regulation, such as under whistle-blowing
legislation or regulation.

•

Whether there are actual or potential threats to the physical safety of the senior
professional accountant or other individuals.

If the senior professional accountant determines that disclosure of the matter to an appropriate
authority is an appropriate course of action in the circumstances, that disclosure is permitted
pursuant to paragraph R114.3 of the Code. When making such disclosure, the accountant shall
act in good faith and exercise caution when making statements and assertions.

Imminent Breach
R260.22

In exceptional circumstances, the senior professional accountant might become aware of actual
or intended conduct that the accountant has reason to believe would constitute an imminent
SECTION 260 Page 48 of 226

THE CODE

breach of a law or regulation that would cause substantial harm to investors, creditors,
employees or the general public. Having first considered whether it would be appropriate to
discuss the matter with management or those charged with governance of the employing
organisation, the accountant shall exercise professional judgement and determine whether to
disclose the matter immediately to an appropriate authority in order to prevent or mitigate the
consequences of such imminent breach. If disclosure is made, that disclosure is permitted
pursuant to paragraph R114.3 of the Code.
Documentation
260.23 A1

In relation to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance that falls within the scope of this
section, the senior professional accountant is encouraged to have the following matters
documented:
•

The matter.

•

The results of discussions with the accountant’s superiors, if any, and those charged with
governance and other parties.

•

How the accountant’s superiors, if any, and those charged with governance have
responded to the matter.

•

The courses of action the accountant considered, the judgements made and the decisions
that were taken.

•

How the accountant is satisfied that the accountant has fulfilled the responsibility set out
in paragraph R260.17.

Responsibilities of Professional Accountants Other than Senior Professional Accountants
R260.24

If, in the course of carrying out professional activities, a professional accountant becomes aware
of information concerning non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant shall
seek to obtain an understanding of the matter. This understanding shall include the nature of the
non-compliance or suspected non-compliance and the circumstances in which it has occurred or
might occur.

260.24 A1

The professional accountant is expected to apply knowledge and expertise, and exercise
professional judgement. However, the accountant is not expected to have a level of understanding
of laws and regulations greater than that which is required for the accountant’s role within the
employing organisation. Whether an act constitutes non-compliance is ultimately a matter to be
determined by a court or other appropriate adjudicative body.

260.24 A2

Depending on the nature and significance of the matter, the professional accountant might
consult on a confidential basis with others within the employing organisation or a professional
body, or with legal counsel.

R260.25

If the professional accountant identifies or suspects that non-compliance has occurred or might
occur, the accountant shall, subject to paragraph R260.9, inform an immediate superior to enable
the superior to take appropriate action. If the accountant’s immediate superior appears to be
involved in the matter, the accountant shall inform the next higher level of authority within the
employing organisation.

R260.26

In exceptional circumstances, the professional accountant may determine that disclosure of the
matter to an appropriate authority is an appropriate course of action. If the accountant does so
pursuant to paragraphs 260.20 A2 and A3, that disclosure is permitted pursuant to paragraph
R114.3 of the Code. When making such disclosure, the accountant shall act in good faith and
exercise caution when making statements and assertions.

Documentation
260.27 A1

In relation to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance that falls within the scope of this
section, the professional accountant is encouraged to have the following matters documented:

PRESSURE TO BREACH THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
Introduction
270.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

270.2

Pressure exerted on, or by, a professional accountant might create an intimidation or other threat
to compliance with one or more of the fundamental principles. This section sets out specific
requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such
circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
General
R270.3

270.3 A1

270.3 A2

A professional accountant shall not:
(a)

Allow pressure from others to result in a breach of compliance with the fundamental
principles; or

(b)

Place pressure on others that the accountant knows, or has reason to believe, would result
in the other individuals breaching the fundamental principles.

A professional accountant might face pressure that creates threats to compliance with the
fundamental principles, for example an intimidation threat, when undertaking a professional
activity. Pressure might be explicit or implicit and might come from:
•

Within the employing organisation, for example, from a colleague or superior.

•

An external individual or organisation such as a vendor, customer or lender.

•

Internal or external targets and expectations.

Examples of pressure that might result in threats to compliance with the fundamental principles
include:
•

Pressure related to conflicts of interest:

Pressure from a family member bidding to act as a vendor to the professional
accountant’s employing organisation to select the family member over another
prospective vendor.

See also Section 210, Conflicts of Interest.
•

Pressure to influence preparation or presentation of information:

expectations.

o

Pressure from elected officials on public sector accountants to misrepresent
programmes or projects to voters.

o

Pressure from colleagues to misstate income, expenditure or rates of return to bias
decision-making on capital projects and acquisitions.

o

Pressure from superiors to approve or process expenditures that are not legitimate
business expenses.

o

Pressure to suppress internal audit reports containing adverse findings.

See also Section 220, Preparation and Presentation of Information.
•

Pressure to act without sufficient expertise or due care:
o

Pressure from superiors to inappropriately reduce the extent of work performed.

o

Pressure from superiors to perform a task without sufficient skills or training or within

See also Section 230, Acting with Sufficient Expertise.

SECTION 270 Page 51 of 226

THE CODE

•

Pressure related to financial interests:
o

Pressure from superiors, colleagues or others, for example, those who might benefit
from participation in compensation or incentive arrangements to manipulate
performance indicators.

See also Section 240, Financial Interests, Compensation and Incentives Linked to
Financial Reporting and Decision Making.
•

Pressure related to inducements:
o

Pressure from others, either internal or external to the employing organisation, to
offer inducements to influence inappropriately the judgement or decision making
process of an individual or organisation.

o

Pressure from colleagues to accept a bribe or other inducement, for example to
accept inappropriate gifts or entertainment from potential vendors in a bidding
process.

See also Section 250, Inducements, Including Gifts and Hospitality.
•

Pressure related to non-compliance with laws and regulations:
o

Pressure to structure a transaction to evade tax.

See also Section 260, Responding to Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations.
•

Pressure related to level of fees:
o

Pressure exerted by a professional accountant on another professional accountant
to provide professional services at a fee level that does not allow for sufficient and
appropriate resources (including human, technological and intellectual resources) to
perform the services in accordance with technical and professional standards.

See also Section 330, Fees and Other Types of Remuneration
270.3 A3

270.3 A4

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats created by pressure include:
•

The intent of the individual who is exerting the pressure and the nature and extent of the
pressure.

•

The application of laws, regulations, and professional standards to the circumstances.

•

The culture and leadership of the employing organisation including the extent to which they
reflect or emphasise the importance of ethical behaviour and the expectation that
employees will act ethically. For example, a corporate culture that tolerates unethical
behaviour might increase the likelihood that the pressure would result in a threat to
compliance with the fundamental principles.

•

Policies and procedures, if any, that the employing organisation has established, such as
ethics or human resources policies that address pressure.

Discussing the circumstances creating the pressure and consulting with others about those
circumstances might assist the professional accountant to evaluate the level of the threat. Such
discussion and consultation, which requires being alert to the principle of confidentiality, might
include:
•

Discussing the matter with the individual who is exerting the pressure to seek to resolve it.

•

Discussing the matter with the accountant’s superior, if the superior is not the individual
exerting the pressure.

•

Escalating the matter within the employing organisation, including when appropriate,
explaining any consequential risks to the organisation, for example with:
o

Higher levels of management.

o

Internal or external auditors.

o

Those charged with governance.

SECTION 270 Page 52 of 226

THE CODE

270.3 A5

•

Disclosing the matter in line with the employing organisation’s policies, including ethics
and whistleblowing policies, using any established mechanism, such as a confidential
ethics hotline.

•

Consulting with:
o

A colleague, superior, human resources personnel, or another professional
accountant;

o

Relevant professional or regulatory bodies or industry associations; or

o

Legal counsel.

An example of an action that might eliminate threats created by pressure is the professional
accountant’s request for a restructure of, or segregation of, certain responsibilities and duties so
that the accountant is no longer involved with the individual or entity exerting the pressure.

Documentation
270.4 A1

The professional accountant is encouraged to document:
•

The facts.

•

The communications and parties with whom these matters were discussed.

•

The courses of action considered.

•

How the matter was addressed.

PART 3 – PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN PUBLIC
PRACTICE

THE CODE

PART 3 - PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN PUBLIC PRACTICE
SECTION 300
APPLYING THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK – PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN
PUBLIC PRACTICE
Introduction
300.1

This Part of the Code sets out requirements and application material for professional accountants
in public practice when applying the conceptual framework set out in Section 120. It does not
describe all of the facts and circumstances, including professional activities, interests and
relationships, that could be encountered by professional accountants in public practice, which
create or might create threats to compliance with the fundamental principles. Therefore, the
conceptual framework requires professional accountants in public practice to be alert for such
facts and circumstances.

300.2

The requirements and application material that apply to professional accountants in public
practice are set out in:

300.3

300.3 (a)

•

Part 3 – Professional Accountants in Public Practice, Sections 300 to 399, which applies
to all professional accountants in public practice, whether they provide assurance services
or not.

•

International Independence Standards as follows:
o

Part 4A – Independence for Audit and Review Engagements, Sections 400 to 899,
which applies to professional accountants in public practice when performing audit
and review engagements.

o

Part 4B – Independence for Assurance Engagements Other than Audit and Review
Engagements, Sections 900 to 999, which applies to professional accountants in
public practice when performing assurance engagements other than audit or review
engagements.

In this Part, the term “professional accountant” refers to individual professional accountants in
public practice and their firms.
In this Part, the term “professional accountant” also applies to professional accountants in
business when providing professional services.

Requirements and Application Material
General
R300.4

A professional accountant shall comply with the fundamental principles set out in Section 110
and apply the conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address
threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.

R300.5

When dealing with an ethics issue, the professional accountant shall consider the context in
which the issue has arisen or might arise. Where an individual who is a professional accountant
in public practice is performing professional activities pursuant to the accountant’s relationship
with the firm, whether as a contractor, employee or owner, the individual shall comply with the
provisions in Part 2 that apply to these circumstances.

300.5 A1

Examples of situations in which the provisions in Part 2 apply to a professional accountant in
public practice include:
•

Facing a conflict of interest when being responsible for selecting a vendor for the firm when
an immediate family member of the accountant might benefit financially from the contract.
The requirements and application material set out in Section 210 apply in these
circumstances.

•

Preparing or presenting financial information for the accountant’s client or firm. The
requirements and application material set out in Section 220 apply in these circumstances.

SECTION 300 Page 55 of 226

THE CODE

300.5 A2

•

Being offered an inducement such as being regularly offered complimentary tickets to
attend sporting events by a supplier of the firm. The requirements and application material
set out in Section 250 apply in these circumstances.

•

Facing pressure from an engagement partner to report chargeable hours inaccurately for a
client engagement. The requirements and application material set out in Section 270 apply
in these circumstances.

The more senior the position of a professional accountant, the greater will be the ability and
opportunity to access information, and to influence policies, decisions made and actions taken
by others involved with the firm. To the extent that they are able to do so, taking into account their
position and seniority in the firm, accountants are expected to encourage and promote an ethicsbased culture in the firm and exhibit ethical behaviour in dealings with individuals with whom, and
entities with which, the accountant or the firm has a professional or business relationship in
accordance with paragraph 120.13 A3. Examples of actions that might be taken include the
introduction, implementation and oversight of:
•

Ethics education and training programmes.

•

Firm processes and performance evaluation and reward criteria that promote an ethical
culture.

•

Ethics and whistle-blowing policies.

•

Policies and procedures designed to prevent non-compliance with laws and regulations.

Identifying Threats
300.6 A1

Threats to compliance with the fundamental principles might be created by a broad range of facts
and circumstances. The categories of threats are described in paragraph 120.6 A3. The following
are examples of facts and circumstances within each of those categories of threats that might
create threats for a professional accountant when undertaking a professional service:
(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

Self-interest Threats
•

A professional accountant having a direct financial interest in a client.

•

A professional accountant quoting a low fee to obtain a new engagement and the
fee is so low that it might be difficult to perform the professional service in accordance
with applicable technical and professional standards for that price.

•

A professional accountant having a close business relationship with a client.

•

A professional accountant having access to confidential information that might be
used for personal gain.

•

A professional accountant discovering a significant error when evaluating the results
of a previous professional service performed by a member of the accountant’s firm.

Self-review Threats
•

A professional accountant issuing an assurance report on the effectiveness of the
operation of financial systems after implementing the systems.

•

A professional accountant having prepared the original data used to generate
records that are the subject matter of the assurance engagement.

Advocacy Threats
•

A professional accountant promoting the interests of, or shares in, a client.

•

A professional accountant acting as an advocate on behalf of a client in litigation or
disputes with third parties.

•

A professional accountant lobbying in favour of legislation on behalf of a client.

Familiarity Threats
•

A professional accountant having a close or immediate family member who is a
director or officer of the client.

SECTION 300 Page 56 of 226

THE CODE

(e)

•

A director or officer of the client, or an employee in a position to exert significant
influence over the subject matter of the engagement, having recently served as the
engagement partner.

•

An audit team member having a long association with the audit client.

•

An individual who is being considered to serve as an appropriate reviewer, as a
safeguard to address a threat, having a close relationship with an individual who
performed the work.

Intimidation Threats
•

A professional accountant being threatened with dismissal from a client engagement
or the firm because of a disagreement about a professional matter.

•

A professional accountant feeling pressured to agree with the judgement of a client
because the client has more expertise on the matter in question.

•

A professional accountant being informed that a planned promotion will not occur
unless the accountant agrees with an inappropriate accounting treatment.

•

A professional accountant having accepted a significant gift from a client and being
threatened that acceptance of this gift will be made public.

Identifying Threats Associated with the Use of Technology
300.6 A2

The following are examples of facts and circumstances relating to the use of technology that
might create threats for a professional accountant when undertaking a professional activity:
•

Self-interest Threats
o
The data available might not be sufficient for the effective use of the technology.
o
The technology might not be appropriate for the purpose for which it is to be used.
o
The accountant might not have sufficient information and expertise, or access to
an expert with sufficient understanding, to use and explain the technology and its
appropriateness for the purpose intended.
(Ref: Para. 230.2).

•

Self-review Threats
o
The technology was designed or developed using the knowledge, expertise or
judgement of the accountant or the firm.

Evaluating Threats
300.7 A1

300.7 A2

The conditions, policies and procedures described in paragraphs 120.6 A1 and 120.8 A2 might
impact the evaluation of whether a threat to compliance with the fundamental principles is at an
acceptable level. Such conditions, policies and procedures might relate to:
(a)

The client and its operating environment; and

(b)

The firm and its operating environment.

The professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat is also impacted by the nature
and scope of the professional service.

The Client and its Operating Environment
300.7 A3

The professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat might be impacted by whether
the client is:
(a)

An audit client and whether the audit client is a public interest entity;

(b)

An assurance client that is not an audit client; or

(c)

A non-assurance client.

For example, providing a non-assurance service to an audit client that is a public interest entity
might be perceived to result in a higher level of threat to compliance with the principle of objectivity
with respect to the audit.

SECTION 300 Page 57 of 226

THE CODE

300.7 A4

The corporate governance structure, including the leadership of a client might promote
compliance with the fundamental principles. Accordingly, a professional accountant’s evaluation
of the level of a threat might also be impacted by a client’s operating environment. For example:
•

The client requires appropriate individuals other than management to ratify or approve the
appointment of a firm to perform an engagement.

•

The client has competent employees with experience and seniority to make managerial
decisions.

•

The client has implemented internal procedures that facilitate objective choices in
tendering non-assurance engagements.

•

The client has a corporate governance structure that provides appropriate oversight and
communications regarding the firm’s services.

The Firm and its Operating Environment
300.7 A5

300.7 A6

A professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat might be impacted by the work
environment within the accountant’s firm and its operating environment. For example:
•

Leadership of the firm that promotes compliance with the fundamental principles and
establishes the expectation that assurance team members will act in the public interest.

•

Policies or procedures for establishing and monitoring compliance with the fundamental
principles by all personnel.

•

Compensation, performance appraisal and disciplinary policies and procedures that
promote compliance with the fundamental principles.

•

Management of the reliance on revenue received from a single client.

•

The engagement partner having authority within the firm for decisions concerning
compliance with the fundamental principles, including any decisions about accepting or
providing services to a client.

•

Educational, training and experience requirements.

•

Processes to facilitate and address internal and external concerns or complaints.

The professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat associated with the use of
technology might also be impacted by the work environment within the accountant’s firm and its
operating environment. For example:
•

Level of corporate oversight and internal controls over the technology.

•

Assessments of the quality and functionality of technology that are undertaken by a thirdparty.

•

Training that is provided regularly to all relevant employees so they obtain and maintain
the professional competence to sufficiently understand, use and explain the technology
and its appropriateness for the purpose intended.

Consideration of New Information or Changes in Facts and Circumstances
300.7 A7

New information or changes in facts and circumstances might:
(a)

Impact the level of a threat; or

(b)

Affect the professional accountant’s conclusions about whether safeguards applied
continue to address identified threats as intended.

In these situations, actions that were already implemented as safeguards might no longer be
effective in addressing threats. Accordingly, the application of the conceptual framework requires
that the professional accountant re-evaluate and address the threats accordingly. (Ref: Paras.
R120.9 and R120.10).
300.7 A8

Examples of new information or changes in facts and circumstances that might impact the level
of a threat include:
•

When the scope of a professional service is expanded.

•

When the client becomes a publicly traded entity or acquires another business unit.
SECTION 300 Page 58 of 226

THE CODE

•

When the firm merges with another firm.

•

When the professional accountant is jointly engaged by two clients and a dispute emerges
between the two clients.

•

When there is a change in the professional accountant’s personal or immediate family
relationships.

Addressing Threats
300.8 A1

Paragraphs R120.10 to 120.10 A2 set out requirements and application material for addressing
threats that are not at an acceptable level.

Examples of Safeguards
300.8 A2

300.8 A3

Safeguards vary depending on the facts and circumstances. Examples of actions that in certain
circumstances might be safeguards to address threats include:
•

Assigning additional time and qualified personnel to required tasks when an engagement
has been accepted might address a self-interest threat.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not a member of the team review the work
performed or advise as necessary might address a self-review threat.

•

Using different partners and teams with separate reporting lines for the provision of nonassurance services to an assurance client might address self-review, advocacy or
familiarity threats.

•

Involving another firm to perform or re-perform part of the engagement might address selfinterest, self-review, advocacy, familiarity or intimidation threats.

•

Disclosing to clients any referral fees or commission arrangements received for
recommending services or products might address a self-interest threat.

•

Separating teams when dealing with matters of a confidential nature might address a selfinterest threat.

The remaining sections of Part 3 and International Independence Standards describe certain
threats that might arise during the course of performing professional services and include
examples of actions that might address threats.

Appropriate Reviewer
300.8 A4

An appropriate reviewer is a professional with the necessary knowledge, skills, experience and
authority to review, in an objective manner, the relevant work performed or service provided.
Such an individual might be a professional accountant.

Communicating with Those Charged with Governance
R300.9

When communicating with those charged with governance in accordance with the Code, a
professional accountant shall determine the appropriate individual(s) within the entity’s
governance structure with whom to communicate. If the accountant communicates with a
subgroup of those charged with governance, the accountant shall determine whether
communication with all of those charged with governance is also necessary so that they are
adequately informed.

300.9 A1

In determining with whom to communicate, a professional accountant might consider:
(a)

The nature and importance of the circumstances; and

(b)

The matter to be communicated.

300.9 A2

Examples of a subgroup of those charged with governance include an audit committee or an
individual member of those charged with governance.

R300.10

If a professional accountant communicates with individuals who have management
responsibilities as well as governance responsibilities, the accountant shall be satisfied that
communication with those individuals adequately informs all of those in a governance role with
whom the accountant would otherwise communicate.

300.10 A1

In some circumstances, all of those charged with governance are involved in managing the entity,
for example, a small business where a single owner manages the entity and no one else has a
SECTION 300 Page 59 of 226

THE CODE

governance role. In these cases, if matters are communicated to individual(s) with management
responsibilities, and those individual(s) also have governance responsibilities, the professional
accountant has satisfied the requirement to communicate with those charged with governance.

SECTION 300 Page 60 of 226

THE CODE

SECTION 310
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Introduction
310.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

310.2

A conflict of interest creates threats to compliance with the principle of objectivity and might create
threats to compliance with the other fundamental principles. Such threats might be created when:

310.3

(a)

A professional accountant provides a professional service related to a particular matter for
two or more clients whose interests with respect to that matter are in conflict; or

(b)

The interests of a professional accountant with respect to a particular matter and the
interests of the client for whom the accountant provides a professional service related to
that matter are in conflict.

This section sets out specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the
conceptual framework to conflicts of interest. When a professional accountant provides an audit,
review or other assurance service, independence is also required in accordance with
International Independence Standards.

Requirements and Application Material
General
R310.4

A professional accountant shall not allow a conflict of interest to compromise professional or
business judgement.

310.4 A1

Examples of circumstances that might create a conflict of interest include:
•

Providing a transaction advisory service to a client seeking to acquire an audit client, where
the firm has obtained confidential information during the course of the audit that might be
relevant to the transaction.

•

Providing advice to two clients at the same time where the clients are competing to acquire
the same company and the advice might be relevant to the parties’ competitive positions.

•

Providing services to a seller and a buyer in relation to the same transaction.

•

Preparing valuations of assets for two parties who are in an adversarial position with
respect to the assets.

•

Representing two clients in the same matter who are in a legal dispute with each other,
such as during divorce proceedings, or the dissolution of a partnership.

•

In relation to a license agreement, providing an assurance report for a licensor on the
royalties due while advising the licensee on the amounts payable.

•

Advising a client to invest in a business in which, for example, the spouse of the
professional accountant has a financial interest.

•

Providing strategic advice to a client on its competitive position while having a joint venture
or similar interest with a major competitor of the client.

•

Advising a client on acquiring a business which the firm is also interested in acquiring.

•

Advising a client on buying a product or service while having a royalty or commission
agreement with a potential seller of that product or service.

Conflict Identification
General
R310.5

Before accepting a new client relationship, engagement, or business relationship, a professional
accountant shall take reasonable steps to identify circumstances that might create a conflict of
interest, and therefore a threat to compliance with one or more of the fundamental principles.
Such steps shall include identifying:
(a)

The nature of the relevant interests and relationships between the parties involved; and
SECTION 310 Page 61 of 226

THE CODE

(b)

The service and its implication for relevant parties.

310.5 A1

An effective conflict identification process assists a professional accountant when taking
reasonable steps to identify interests and relationships that might create an actual or potential
conflict of interest, both before determining whether to accept an engagement and throughout
the engagement. Such a process includes considering matters identified by external parties, for
example clients or potential clients. The earlier an actual or potential conflict of interest is
identified, the greater the likelihood of the accountant being able to address threats created by
the conflict of interest.

310.5 A2

An effective process to identify actual or potential conflicts of interest will take into account factors
such as:

310.5 A3

•

The nature of the professional services provided.

•

The size of the firm.

•

The size and nature of the client base.

•

The structure of the firm, for example, the number and geographic location of offices.

More information on client acceptance is set out in Section 320, Professional Appointments.

Changes in Circumstances
R310.6

A professional accountant shall remain alert to changes over time in the nature of services,
interests and relationships that might create a conflict of interest while performing an
engagement.

310.6 A1

The nature of services, interests and relationships might change during the engagement. This is
particularly true when a professional accountant is asked to conduct an engagement in a situation
that might become adversarial, even though the parties who engage the accountant initially might
not be involved in a dispute.

Network Firms
R310.7

If the firm is a member of a network, a professional accountant shall consider conflicts of interest
that the accountant has reason to believe might exist or arise due to interests and relationships
of a network firm.

310.7 A1

Factors to consider when identifying interests and relationships involving a network firm include:
•

The nature of the professional services provided.

•

The clients served by the network.

•

The geographic locations of all relevant parties.

Threats Created by Conflicts of Interest
310.8 A1

In general, the more direct the connection between the professional service and the matter on
which the parties’ interests conflict, the more likely the level of the threat is not at an acceptable
level.

310.8 A2

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of a threat created by a conflict of interest include
measures that prevent unauthorised disclosure of confidential information when performing
professional services related to a particular matter for two or more clients whose interests with
respect to that matter are in conflict. These measures include:

310.8 A3

•

The existence of separate practice areas for specialty functions within the firm, which might
act as a barrier to the passing of confidential client information between practice areas.

•

Policies and procedures to limit access to client files.

•

Confidentiality agreements signed by personnel and partners of the firm.

•

Separation of confidential information physically and electronically.

•

Specific and dedicated training and communication.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address threats created by a conflict of interest
include:
•

Having separate teams who are provided with clear policies and procedures on
SECTION 310 Page 62 of 226

THE CODE

maintaining confidentiality.
•

Having an appropriate reviewer, who is not involved in providing the service or otherwise
affected by the conflict, review the work performed to assess whether the key judgements
and conclusions are appropriate.

Disclosure and Consent
General
R310.9

A professional accountant shall exercise professional judgement to determine whether the nature
and significance of a conflict of interest are such that specific disclosure and explicit consent are
necessary when addressing the threat created by the conflict of interest.

310.9 A1

Factors to consider when determining whether specific disclosure and explicit consent are
necessary include:

310.9 A2

310.9 A3

310.9 A4

•

The circumstances creating the conflict of interest.

•

The parties that might be affected.

•

The nature of the issues that might arise.

•

The potential for the particular matter to develop in an unexpected manner.

Disclosure and consent might take different forms, for example:
•

General disclosure to clients of circumstances where, as is common commercial practice,
the professional accountant does not provide professional services exclusively to any one
client (for example, in a particular professional service and market sector). This enables
the client to provide general consent accordingly. For example, an accountant might make
general disclosure in the standard terms and conditions for the engagement.

•

Specific disclosure to affected clients of the circumstances of the particular conflict in
sufficient detail to enable the client to make an informed decision about the matter and to
provide explicit consent accordingly. Such disclosure might include a detailed presentation
of the circumstances and a comprehensive explanation of any planned safeguards and
the risks involved.

•

Consent might be implied by clients’ conduct in circumstances where the professional
accountant has sufficient evidence to conclude that clients know the circumstances at the
outset and have accepted the conflict of interest if they do not raise an objection to the
existence of the conflict.

It is generally necessary:
(a)

To disclose the nature of the conflict of interest and how any threats created were
addressed to clients affected by a conflict of interest; and

(b)

To obtain consent of the affected clients to perform the professional services when
safeguards are applied to address the threat.

If such disclosure or consent is not in writing, the professional accountant is encouraged to
document:
(a)

The nature of the circumstances giving rise to the conflict of interest;

(b)

The safeguards applied to address the threats when applicable; and

(c)

The consent obtained.

When Explicit Consent is Refused
R310.10

If a professional accountant has determined that explicit consent is necessary in accordance with
paragraph R310.9 and the client has refused to provide consent, the accountant shall either:
(a)

End or decline to perform professional services that would result in the conflict of interest;
or

(b)

End relevant relationships or dispose of relevant interests to eliminate the threat or reduce
it to an acceptable level.

Confidentiality
SECTION 310 Page 63 of 226

THE CODE

General
R310.11

A professional accountant shall remain alert to the principle of confidentiality, including when
making disclosures or sharing information within the firm or network and seeking guidance from
third parties.

310.11 A1

Subsection 114 sets out requirements and application material relevant to situations that might
create a threat to compliance with the principle of confidentiality.

When Disclosure to Obtain Consent would Breach Confidentiality
R310.12

310.12 A1

When making specific disclosure for the purpose of obtaining explicit consent would result in a
breach of confidentiality, and such consent cannot therefore be obtained, the firm shall only
accept or continue an engagement if:
(a)

The firm does not act in an advocacy role for one client in an adversarial position against
another client in the same matter;

(b)

Specific measures are in place to prevent disclosure of confidential information between
the teams serving the two clients; and

(c)

The firm is satisfied that a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude
that it is appropriate for the firm to accept or continue the engagement because a restriction
on the firm’s ability to provide the professional service would produce a disproportionate
adverse outcome for the clients or other relevant third parties.

A breach of confidentiality might arise, for example, when seeking consent to perform:
•

A transaction-related service for a client in a hostile takeover of another client of the firm.

•

A forensic investigation for a client regarding a suspected fraud, where the firm has
confidential information from its work for another client who might be involved in the fraud.

Documentation
R310.13

In the circumstances set out in paragraph R310.12, the professional accountant shall document:
(a)

The nature of the circumstances, including the role that the accountant is to undertake;

(b)

The specific measures in place to prevent disclosure of information between the teams
serving the two clients; and

(c)

Why it is appropriate to accept or continue the engagement.

SECTION 320
PROFESSIONAL APPOINTMENTS
Introduction
320.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

320.2

Acceptance of a new client relationship or changes in an existing engagement might create a
threat to compliance with one or more of the fundamental principles. This section sets out specific
requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such
circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
Client and Engagement Acceptance
General
320.3 A1

Threats to compliance with the principles of integrity or professional behaviour might be created,
for example, from questionable issues associated with the client (its owners, management or
activities). Issues that, if known, might create such a threat include client involvement in illegal
activities, dishonesty, questionable financial reporting practices or other unethical behaviour.

320.3 A2

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:
•

Knowledge and understanding of the client, its owners, management and those charged with
governance and business activities.

•

The client’s commitment to address the questionable issues, for example, through
improving corporate governance practices or internal controls.

320.3 A3

A self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional competence and due care is
created if the team does not possess, or cannot acquire, the competencies to perform the
professional services.

320.3 A4

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:
•

320.3 A5

An appropriate understanding of:
o

The nature of the client’s business;

o

The complexity of its operations;

o

The requirements of the engagement; and

o

The purpose, nature and scope of the work to be performed.

•

Knowledge of relevant industries or subject matter.

•

Experience with relevant regulatory or reporting requirements.

•

Policies and procedures that the firm has implemented, as part of a system of quality
management in accordance with quality management standards such as ISQM 1, that
respond to quality risks relating to the firm’s ability to perform the engagement in
accordance with professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

•

The level of fees and the extent to which they have regard to the resources required, taking
into account the professional accountant’s commercial and market priorities.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address a self-interest threat include:
•

Assigning sufficient engagement personnel with the necessary competencies.

•

Agreeing on a realistic time frame for the performance of the engagement.

•

Using experts where necessary.

THE CODE

Changes in a Professional Appointment
General
R320.4

A professional accountant shall determine whether there are any reasons for not accepting an
engagement when the accountant:
(a)

Is asked by a potential client to replace another accountant;

(b)

Considers tendering for an engagement held by another accountant; or

(c)

Considers undertaking work that is complementary or additional to that of another
accountant.

320.4 A1

There might be reasons for not accepting an engagement. One such reason might be if a threat
created by the facts and circumstances cannot be addressed by applying safeguards. For
example, there might be a self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional
competence and due care if a professional accountant accepts the engagement before knowing
all the relevant facts.

320.4 A2

If a professional accountant is asked to undertake work that is complementary or additional to
the work of an existing or predecessor accountant, a self-interest threat to compliance with the
principle of professional competence and due care might be created, for example, as a result of
incomplete information.

320.4 A3

A factor that is relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat is whether tenders state that,
before accepting the engagement, contact with the existing or predecessor accountant will be
requested. This contact gives the proposed accountant the opportunity to inquire whether there
are any reasons why the engagement should not be accepted.

320.4 A4

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:
•

Asking the existing or predecessor accountant to provide any known information of which,
in the existing or predecessor accountant’s opinion, the proposed accountant needs to be
aware before deciding whether to accept the engagement. For example, inquiry might
reveal previously undisclosed pertinent facts and might indicate disagreements with the
existing or predecessor accountant that might influence the decision to accept the
appointment.

•

Obtaining information from other sources such as through inquiries of third parties or
background investigations regarding senior management or those charged with
governance of the client.

Communicating with the Existing or Predecessor Accountant
R320.5

Having been asked to accept an appointment, the professional accountant shall at least
seek to contact the existing or predecessor accountant, irrespective of whether the
existing or predecessor accountant works in public practice or not. This includes
circumstances where the professional accountant is asked to undertake work which is
relevant to the work of an ongoing existing accountant unless the client provides
acceptable reasons why the existing accountant cannot be informed.

320.5 A1

A proposed accountant will usually need the client’s permission, preferably in writing, to initiate
discussions with the existing or predecessor accountant.

SECTION 320 Page 66 of 226

THE CODE

320.5A2

R320.6

Care must be taken when communicating all relevant facts to a proposed accountant
in situations where the existing or predecessor accountant knows or suspects that
their client is involved in money laundering or a terrorist activity. It is important that:
•

The proposed accountant does not specifically enquire whether the existing
accountant has reported suspicions of money laundering or terrorism. Such
questions place the existing accountant in a difficult position and are likely not
to be answered.

•

The proposed accountant does not ask the existing accountant whether client
identification or ‘knowing your client’ procedures have been carried out under
anti-money laundering legislation. The proposed accountant has responsibility
for obtaining information for client identification and ‘knowing your client’ and
this cannot be delegated to the existing accountant.

If unable to communicate with the existing or predecessor accountant, the proposed accountant
shall take other reasonable steps to obtain information about any possible threats.

R320.6A

In circumstances where the enquiries referred to above are not answered, the
proposed accountant shall write to the existing accountant by recorded delivery
service stating an intention to accept the engagement in the absence of a reply
within a specific and reasonable period.

320.6A1

The proposed accountant is entitled to assume that the existing accountant’s silence
implies there was no adverse comment to be made, although this does not obviate the
requirement in R320.6 to take other reasonable steps.

Communicating with the Proposed Accountant
R320.7

R320.7A

320.7 A1

320.7 A2

When an existing or predecessor accountant is asked to respond to a communication from a
proposed accountant, the existing or predecessor accountant shall:
(a)

Comply with relevant laws and regulations governing the request; and

(b)

Provide any information honestly and unambiguously.

If the client fails or refuses to grant the existing accountant permission to discuss
the client’s affairs with the proposed accountant, the existing accountant shall report
this fact to the proposed accountant who shall consider carefully the reason for
such failure or refusal when determining whether or not to accept
nomination/appointment.
An existing or predecessor accountant is bound by confidentiality. Whether the existing or
predecessor accountant is permitted or required to discuss the affairs of a client with a proposed
accountant will depend on the nature of the engagement and:
(a)

Whether the existing or predecessor accountant has permission from the client for the
discussion; and

(b)

The legal and ethics requirements relating to such communications and disclosure, which
might vary by jurisdiction.

Circumstances where a professional accountant is or might be required to disclose confidential
information, or when disclosure might be appropriate, are set out in paragraph 114.3 A1 of the
Code.

SECTION 320 Page 67 of 226

THE CODE

R320.7B

If the existing accountant has made one or more suspicious activity reports relating
to money laundering or terrorism, the existing accountant shall not disclose that
fact to the prospective accountant, or make other disclosures that could amount
to tipping off.

320.7 A3

Disclosure of money laundering or terrorist suspicion reporting by the existing accountant
to the proposed accountant needs to be avoided because this information may be
discussed with the client or former client

Transfer of records
R320.7C

An existing accountant shall deal promptly with any reasonable request for the
transfer of records and may have the right of particular lien if there are unpaid fees.

R320.7D

The prospective accountant often asks the existing accountant for information as
to the client’s affairs. If the client is unable to provide the information and lack
thereof might prejudice the client’s interests, such information shall be promptly
given. In such circumstances, no charge shall normally be made unless there is
good reason to the contrary.

320.7 A4

An example of a reason to make a charge would be that a significant amount of work is
involved.

Changes in Audit or Review Appointments
R320.8

In the case of an audit or review of financial statements, a professional accountant shall request
the existing or predecessor accountant to provide known information regarding any facts or other
information of which, in the existing or predecessor accountant’s opinion, the proposed
accountant needs to be aware before deciding whether to accept the engagement. Except for
the circumstances involving non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with laws and
regulations set out in paragraphs R360.21 and R360.22:
(a)

If the client consents to the existing or predecessor accountant disclosing any such facts
or other information, the existing or predecessor accountant shall provide the information
honestly and unambiguously; and

(b)

If the client fails or refuses to grant the existing or predecessor accountant permission to
discuss the client’s affairs with the proposed accountant, the existing or predecessor
accountant shall disclose this fact to the proposed accountant, who shall carefully consider
such failure or refusal when determining whether to accept the appointment.

Client and Engagement Continuance
R320.9

For a recurring client engagement, a professional accountant shall periodically review whether
to continue with the engagement.

320.9 A1

Potential threats to compliance with the fundamental principles might be created after acceptance
which, had they been known earlier, would have caused the professional accountant to decline the
engagement. For example, a self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of integrity might be
created by improper earnings management or balance sheet valuations.

Using the Work of an Expert
R320.10

When a professional accountant intends to use the work of an expert in the course of undertaking
a professional activity, the accountant shall determine whether the use is appropriate for the
intended purpose.

320.10 A1

Factors to consider when a professional accountant intends to use the work of an expert include:
•

The reputation and expertise of, and the resources available, to the expert.

•

Whether the expert is subject to applicable professional and ethics standards.

SECTION 320 Page 68 of 226

THE CODE

Such information might be gained from prior association with, or from consulting others about,
the expert.
Using the Output of Technology
R320.11

When a professional accountant intends to use the output of technology in the course of
undertaking a professional activity, the accountant shall determine whether the use is appropriate
for the intended purpose.

320.11 A1 Factors to consider when a professional accountant intends to use the output of technology
include:
•

The nature of the activity to be performed by the technology.

•

The expected use of, or extent of reliance on, the output of the technology.

•

Whether the accountant has the ability, or access to an expert with the ability, to
understand, use and explain the technology and its appropriateness for the purpose
intended.

•

Whether the technology used has been appropriately tested and evaluated for the purpose
intended.

•

Prior experience with the technology and whether its use for specific purposes is generally
accepted.

•

The firm’s oversight of the design, development, implementation, operation, maintenance,
monitoring, updating or upgrading of the technology.

•

The controls relating to the use of the technology, including procedures for authorising user
access to the technology and overseeing such use.

•

The appropriateness of the inputs to the technology, including data and any related
decisions, and decisions made by individuals in the course of using the technology.

Other Considerations
320.12 A1 When a professional accountant is considering using the work of experts or the output of
technology, a consideration is whether the accountant is in a position within the firm to obtain
information in relation to the factors necessary to determine whether such use is appropriate.

SECTION 321
SECOND OPINIONS
Introduction
321.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

321.2

Providing a second opinion to an entity that is not an existing client might create a self-interest or
other threat to compliance with one or more of the fundamental principles. This section sets out
specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in
such circumstances.

This section does not apply to expert evidence assignments, opinions pursuant to litigation and opinions
provided jointly to other firms and their clients jointly.

Requirements and Application Material
General
R321.3

A professional accountant shall, when providing a second opinion:
(a) Confirm oral opinions in writing as soon as practicable after giving the opinion;
(b) If asked for a general opinion relative to a hypothetical situation, ensure that the
recipient of the opinion understands that it has been given in the context of that
particular hypothetical situation only.

321.3 A1

A professional accountant might be asked to provide a second opinion on the application of
accounting, auditing, reporting or other standards or principles to (a) specific circumstances, or
(b) transactions by or on behalf of a company or an entity that is not an existing client. A threat,
for example, a self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional competence
and due care, might be created if the second opinion is not based on the same facts that the
existing or predecessor accountant had, or is based on inadequate evidence.

321.3 A2

A factor that is relevant in evaluating the level of such a self-interest threat is the circumstances
of the request and all the other available facts and assumptions relevant to the expression of a
professional judgement.

321.3 A3

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:
•

With the client’s permission, obtaining information from the existing or predecessor
accountant.

•

Describing the limitations surrounding any opinion in communications with the client.

•

Providing the existing or predecessor accountant with a copy of the opinion.

When Permission to Communicate is Not Provided
R321.4

321.4 A1

If an entity seeking a second opinion from a professional accountant will not permit the
accountant to communicate with the existing or predecessor accountant, the accountant shall
determine whether the accountant may provide the second opinion sought.
A professional accountant providing a second opinion will generally need to seek contact with
the existing or predecessor accountant (particularly if the existing accountant is engaged as
auditor. This is necessary to ascertain the circumstances in which the consultation has been
made, and to be apprised of all the facts relevant to the issues at the time the opinion is given.
If the client will not allow the opinion giver to carry out the steps referred to above, it will
generally be appropriate for the opinion-giver to decline to act, particularly if the existing
accountant is engaged as auditor.

SECTION 325
OBJECTIVITY OF AN ENGAGEMENT QUALITY REVIEWER AND OTHER
APPROPRIATE REVIEWERS
Introduction
325.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

325.2

Appointing an engagement quality reviewer who has involvement in the work being reviewed or
close relationships with those responsible for performing that work might create threats to
compliance with the principle of objectivity.

325.3

This section sets out specific application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework
in relation to the objectivity of an engagement quality reviewer.

325.4

An engagement quality reviewer is also an example of an appropriate reviewer as described in
paragraph 300.8 A4. Therefore, the application material in this section might apply in
circumstances where a professional accountant appoints an appropriate reviewer to review work
performed as a safeguard to address identified threats.

Application Material
General
325.5 A1

Quality engagements are achieved through planning and performing engagements and reporting
on them in accordance with professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements. ISQM 1 establishes the firm’s responsibilities for its system of quality management
and requires the firm to design and implement responses to address quality risks related to
engagement performance. Such responses include establishing policies or procedures
addressing engagement quality reviews in accordance with ISQM 2.

325.5 A2

An engagement quality reviewer is a partner, other individual in the firm, or an external individual,
appointed by the firm to perform the engagement quality review.

Identifying Threats
325.6 A1

The following are examples of circumstances where threats to the objectivity of a professional
accountant appointed as an engagement quality reviewer might be created:
(a)

Self-interest threat
•

(b)

Self-review threat
•

(c)

An accountant serving as an engagement quality reviewer on an audit engagement
after previously serving as the engagement partner.

Familiarity threat
•

(d)

Two engagement partners each serving as an engagement quality reviewer for the
other’s engagement.

An accountant serving as an engagement quality reviewer has a close relationship
with or is an immediate family member of another individual who is involved in the
engagement.

Intimidation threat
•

An accountant serving as an engagement quality reviewer for an engagement has
a direct reporting line to the partner responsible for the engagement.

Evaluating Threats
325.7 A1

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats to the objectivity of an individual
appointed as an engagement quality reviewer include:
•

The role and seniority of the individual.

•

The nature of the individual’s relationship with others involved on the engagement.

•

The length of time the individual was previously involved with the engagement and the
SECTION 325 Page 71 of 226

THE CODE

individual’s role.
•

When the individual was last involved in the engagement prior to being appointed as
engagement quality reviewer and any subsequent relevant changes to the circumstances
of the engagement.

•

The nature and complexity of issues that required significant judgement from the individual
in any previous involvement in the engagement.

Addressing Threats
325.8 A1

An example of an action that might eliminate an intimidation threat is reassigning reporting
responsibilities within the firm.

325.8 A2

An example of an action that might be a safeguard to address a self-review threat is implementing
a period of sufficient duration (a cooling-off period) before the individual who was on the
engagement is appointed as an engagement quality reviewer.

Cooling-off Period
325.8 A3

ISQM 2 requires the firm to establish policies or procedures that specify, as a condition for
eligibility, a cooling-off period of two years before the engagement partner can assume the role
of engagement quality reviewer. This serves to enable compliance with the principle of objectivity
and the consistent performance of quality engagements.

325.8 A4

The cooling-off period required by ISQM 2 is distinct from, and does not modify, the partner
rotation requirements in Section 540, which are designed to address threats to independence
created by long association with an audit client.

SECTION 330
FEES AND OTHER TYPES OF REMUNERATION
Introduction
330.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

330.2

The level and nature of fee and other remuneration arrangements might create a self-interest
threat to compliance with one or more of the fundamental principles. This section sets out specific
application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.

Application Material
Level of Fees
330.3 A1

The level of fees might impact a professional accountant’s ability to perform professional services
in accordance with technical and professional standards.

330.3 A2

A professional accountant might quote whatever fee is considered appropriate. Quoting a fee
lower than another accountant is not in itself unethical. However, the level of fees quoted creates
a self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional competence and due care if
the fee quoted is so low that it might be difficult to perform the engagement in accordance with
applicable technical and professional standards.

330.3 A3

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:

330.3 A4

•

Whether the client is aware of the terms of the engagement and, in particular, the basis on
which fees are determined and which professional services are covered.

•

Whether the level of the fee is set by an independent third party such as a regulatory body.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:
•

Adjusting the level of fees or the scope of the engagement.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer review the work performed.

SECTION 330 Page 73 of 226

THE CODE

R330.4

A professional accountant shall explain the basis on which fees will be calculated and
provide an estimated initial fee where applicable. A professional accountant shall give
the client this information at the earliest opportunity.

330.4 A1

Fee levels are a commercial matter, but may be determined by:
•

The seniority and expertise of the individuals performing the work;

•

Time spent;

•

The risk and responsibility of the work;

•

The nature of the client’s business;

•

The priority and importance of the work to the client;

•

Expenses properly incurred.

R330.5

A professional accountant shall provide fee quotes or details of the basis of fees in
writing, either before the beginning of the engagement, or as soon as possible after the
start of the engagement. This information would normally be provided in the
engagement letter. If there is no engagement letter, then the professional accountant
shall provide a specific document containing these details.

R330.6

If audit or assurance work has been obtained by a fee quote that is low compared to
existing fees, a professional accountant shall be aware of the risk of an actual or
perceived self-interest threat. In particular, the risk of the perception that the objectivity
or quality of the work could be compromised. A professional accountant shall ensure
that work for which the accountant is responsible complies with relevant standards,
guidelines and regulations, in particular quality control.

R330.7

A professional accountant shall not mislead clients about the basis of fees for current
or future work.

Contingent Fees
330.4 A1

Contingent fees are used for certain types of non-assurance services. However, contingent fees
might create threats to compliance with the fundamental principles, particularly a self-interest
threat to compliance with the principle of objectivity, in certain circumstances.

330.4 A2

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such threats include:

330.4 A3

•

The nature of the engagement.

•

The range of possible fee amounts.

•

The basis for determining the fee.

•

Disclosure to intended users of the work performed by the professional accountant and
the basis of remuneration.

•

Quality management policies and procedures.

•

Whether an independent third party is to review the outcome or result of the transaction.

•

Whether the level of the fee is set by an independent third party such as a regulatory body.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:
•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in performing the non-assurance
service review the work performed by the professional accountant.

•

Obtaining an advance written agreement with the client on the basis of remuneration.

SECTION 330 Page 74 of 226

THE CODE

330.4 A4

330.4 A5

Requirements and application material related to contingent fees for services provided to audit
or review clients and other assurance clients are set out in International Independence
Standards.
For formal appointments under the insolvency legislation e.g. bankruptcies, liquidations and
administrations, the professional accountant might be required by statute to base fees on a
percentage of:
•

Realisations of value or property dealt with; or

•

Distributions,

rather than the bases outlined in 330.4A1
330.4 A6

For Corporate Finance services where no professional opinion is given, such as advising on:
•

Management Buy-Ins;

•

Management Buy-Outs;

•

Raising Venture Capital;

•

Acquisition searches; or

•

Sales Mandates

A contingent fee basis might be more appropriate than a fee calculated on the bases outlined
in 330.4A1.
330.4. A7

Due to the higher level of risk and responsibility associated with Due Diligence assignments, it
may be appropriate to charge a higher fee for a transaction that completes, than for one that is
aborted. Any higher fee may reflect the additional risk and responsibility.

Fee Information and Disputes
R330.4B.1 If a client requests a fee breakdown then the professional accountant shall provide one.
The breakdown shall contain enough detail for the client to understand how the fee has
been calculated.
R330.4B.2 If a professional accountant issues a fee in excess of the previous quote or estimate,
then the professional accountant shall explain the reason for the excess, and how the
excess has been calculated.
330.4B.A1

If the client has not paid fees due, the professional accountant might have the right to retain
certain books and papers of the client. The professional accountant should refer to S320
‘Professional Appointment’.

R330.4B.3 A professional accountant shall take reasonable steps to attempt to resolve any fee
dispute
330.4B.A2

If a client is overdue in paying fees owed, it could create a real or perceived self-interest threat
for a professional accountant. See R112 Objectivity.

Referral Fees or Commissions
330.5 A1

A self-interest threat to compliance with the principles of objectivity and professional competence
and due care is created if a professional accountant pays or receives a referral fee or receives a
commission relating to a client. Such referral fees or commissions include, for example:
•

A fee paid to another professional accountant for the purposes of obtaining new client work
when the client continues as a client of the existing accountant but requires specialist
services not offered by that accountant.
SECTION 330 Page 75 of 226

THE CODE

330.5 A2

•

A fee received for referring a continuing client to another professional accountant or other
expert where the existing accountant does not provide the specific professional service
required by the client.

•

A commission received from a third party (for example, a software vendor) in connection
with the sale of goods or services to a client.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:
•

Obtaining an advance agreement from the client for commission arrangements in
connection with the sale by another party of goods or services to the client might address
a self-interest threat.

•

Disclosing to clients any referral fees or commission arrangements paid to, or received
from, another professional accountant or third party for recommending services or products
might address a self-interest threat.

SECTION 330 Page 76 of 226

THE CODE

R330.5B

If a professional accountant, or an associate, receives any kind of fee, commission,
payment, or benefit (“the commission”) in connection with the referral of the
professional accountant’s client, the professional accountant shall obtain explicit
written consent to retain the commission. This requirement exists regardless of the
amount of the commission. Client consent shall be achieved one of in the following
ways:
a)

b)

A professional accountant may include a clause in their engagement letter that
specifies that the firm will retain commission payments received in relation to
referrals of the client to third parties. The clause shall state that by the client
signing the engagement letter they are providing consent to the firm retaining the
commission. The engagement letter shall include examples that provide a fair
indication of the amount of expected commission. If the amount of commission
received is significantly in excess of the amounts indicated in the engagement
letter, the firm shall also write to the client promptly following receipt of the
commission and shall specify:
•

The amount and if relevant the frequency of the commission received;

•

What the commission was received for;

•

How the commission was calculated;

•

The payer and payee of the commission.

If there is no general clause in the engagement letter which provides a fair
indication of the expected commission, a professional accountant may obtain
advance specific written consent for the receipt of any commission. This consent
from the client shall detail:
•

The amount and if relevant the frequency of the commission the
professional accountant will receive;

•

What the commission will be received for;

•

How the commission will be calculated;

•

The payer and payee of the commission.

A professional accountant shall obtain explicit written consent from the client for
the commission payment to be retained.
c)

If advance consent has not been obtained either in general (point a) or specifically
(point b), a professional accountant shall make full disclosure to the client within
a reasonable period of time following receipt of the commission. The professional
accountant shall provide the following details to the client in writing:
•

The amount and if relevant the frequency of the commission the
professional accountant has received;

•

What the commission was received for;

•

How the commission was calculated;

•

The payer and payee of the commission.

The professional accountant shall ask the client for explicit written consent for the
commission payment to be retained. If a professional accountant has made
reasonable efforts to obtain written consent from the client for retention of the

SECTION 330 Page 77 of 226

THE CODE

commission, but the client has not responded, then the professional accountant
may presume consent to retain the commission. The professional accountant
would however need to demonstrate that they had made reasonable efforts to
obtain consent.
330.5B. A1 Where a professional accountant acts as agent for a client, or gives them professional advice,
there will be a fiduciary relationship between the professional accountant and the client. This
means that the professional accountant has a legal obligation to obtain informed consent from
the client, if the professional accountant wants to retain any commission, fee, or other benefit
received from a third party in connection with the referral of the client.
330.5B. A2 The term ‘associate’ of a professional accountant includes the following:
•

A close or immediate family member;.

•

A business partner;

•

Any company or business in which there are common shareholdings with the
professional accountant’s company or business, or which have the same beneficial
owner(s); or one of the companies or business controls or owns the other.

330.5B. A3 The examples of associates are not exhaustive, and the substance of the association between
the professional accountant and the recipient of the commission should be considered.
330.5B.A4

A professional accountant might consider that a payment the professional accountant receives
in connection with the referral of a client, is in substance a fee for services rendered, and not
commission. In these circumstances the professional accountant should be able to
demonstrate that the fee received is not disproportionate to the scope of the services provided.
The fee should nevertheless be disclosed to the client with details of what services the fee
represents.

Purchase or Sale of a Firm
330.6 A1

A professional accountant may purchase all or part of another firm on the basis that payments
will be made to individuals formerly owning the firm or to their heirs or estates. Such payments
are not referral fees or commissions for the purposes of this section

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

331.2

If a professional accountant receives referred work, refers work to others, or establishes an
agency arrangement, this might create a self-interest threat to compliance with one or more of
the fundamental principles. A referral may be a formal request made in the course of a
professional relationship, for advice on the selection of a potential professional adviser. A
referral may also be an informal request, including where there is no existing relationship
between the professional accountant and the enquirer. This section sets out specific application
material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.

331.3

The requirements in respect of referral fees are detailed in section 330.

Requirements and Application Material
Duty of Care
331.4 A1

When a professional accountant makes a referral, a duty of care may arise. The extent of a
duty of care varies according to the circumstances, including whether the exchange or
provision of information was solicited or not. A greater duty of care will arise for matters which
are reasonably expected to be within a professional accountant’s knowledge or where a fee is
charged. A professional accountant needs to consider the expectations of their knowledge from
the client’s or enquirer’s perspective:
•

Where a referral fee is received, or where the service referred is in a professional
sphere, the client (or enquirer) can reasonably presume knowledge by the professional
accountant. Any limitation in knowledge would clearly need to be explained.

•

Where the enquiry relates to a service outside the normal sphere of expertise of an
accountant, and no referral fee is contemplated, then it is reasonable to presume that
the enquiry is being made in a personal capacity, unless circumstances suggest
otherwise. It is still advisable to express any limitations of knowledge and to clarify, in
case of doubt, that any opinion is based on personal experience rather than in a
professional capacity.

R331.5

Professional accountants shall consider whether it would be in their interest for any
knowledge limitations to be disclosed in writing, according to the circumstances.

331.5 A1

Factors that are relevant in such a consideration include:
•

The nature of the professional relationship with the enquirer (an existing client,
someone who could reasonably be considered to be making the enquiry as a
prospective client or a casual enquiry).

•

The context in which the enquiry is made. Is it professional or personal, casual or
formal?

SECTION 331 Page 79 of 226

THE CODE

•

The nature of the personal relationship. Does the enquirer know the professional
accountant is a Chartered Accountant and are they consulting them as a respected
professional?

•

The scope of enquiry and whether a referral fee is contemplated, as considered in
section 330.

•

The enquirer’s expectations.

R331.6

The professional accountants shall consider the fitness for purpose of the third party to
whom a referral is proposed, to address the client’s needs.

331.6 A1

A referral arises typically, when the professional accountant does not have the expertise and/or
resource in house to undertake the potential engagement. It follows that the professional
accountant will not necessarily know enough to be able completely to assess whether the third
party is the optimum choice or not. This is an inevitable limitation in most referrals, and what
the referral is based on will vary.

331.6 A2

In making that consideration of fitness for purpose, the professional accountant:
•

Can take account of the professional or regulatory status of the prospective referee.

R331.7

A professional accountant shall not make a referral to a third party, even with a
disclaimer, if they know of a better alternative. Where the referral relates to an end
product or service, rather than an intermediary, and the professional accountant knows
there are other alternatives but does not know if they are better, this shall be explained.

331.7 A1

If the client or enquirer insists on being referred to a particular third party and the professional
accountant believes there is a better alternative, the reference may be made but the client or
enquirer should be made aware of the professional accountant’s concerns.

R331.8

If the professional accountant has a relationship with the third party, for example a
family connection or an automatic referral arrangement, there are clear self-interest or
familiarity threats and the connection shall be disclosed.

331.8 A1

This is particularly important where a professional accountant is considering recommending
the products of another supplier with which there is an agency, and/or a principal or employee
of the professional accountant’s firm is a principal or officer of the other supplier.

331.8 A2

The requirement to disclose includes situations where in substance there is a one-to-one
relationship between the professional accountant and the third party (for example, the
professional accountant is the only accountant in the area and the third party is the only
solicitor), as this implies automatic referral.

331.9 A1

In summary, the duty of care requirements and application material in 331.4 A1 to 331.8 A2
mean that professional accountants should:
•

Consider any factors they are aware of that would indicate the proposed third party is
not fit for purpose in terms of the potential engagement. The professional accountant
should take into account what a reasonable person might expect a Chartered
Accountant to know;

•

Make clients (or enquirers), that are proposed to be referred, aware of limitations in
knowledge;

•

Disclose any referral arrangement and any potential benefit they will receive;

SECTION 331 Page 80 of 226

THE CODE

•

Ensure that any contractual arrangement does not override the needs of an individual
client.

Establishing Agencies
331.10

The guidance which follows is intended to assist professional accountants in their
arrangements with other suppliers of services and products. It addresses agreements that in
effect provide for permanent arrangements for referrals. The issues are considered to be similar
to those above for referrals in general except that an agency contract will usually bind the agent
in terms of whom it can refer to for particular types of work.

R331.11

When professional accountants are considering the establishment of an agency, the
terms of the agency contract (actual or implied) shall not require exclusive referral of all
clients regardless of suitability.

331.11 A1

For example, professional accountants could not be party to an agency by which they are
constrained to channel all funds received by it for investment into a single bank/building society.
Such a clause would make important safeguards inoperable.

R331.12

Before accepting appointment as auditor or assurance provider of another entity of
which they are an agent, professional accountants shall consider whether the agency
constitutes a material business relationship and thus breach the independence
requirements in Part 4.

R331.13

professional accountants shall not, because of the self-interest threat, enter into any
financial arrangements with another supplier either personally or through their firm
which would prejudice the objectivity of themselves or their firm.

R331.14

Before accepting or continuing an agency with another supplier, professional
accountants should satisfy themselves that their ability to discharge their professional
obligations to their clients is not compromised.

R331.15

A professional accountant shall not in any circumstances conduct his or her practice in
such a manner as to give the impression that the professional accountant is a principal
rather than an agent.

331.15 A1

This includes considering signs on premises and any other outward signs or literature used.
This would relate in particular to agencies with entities such as banks and building societies,
where confusion as to status can arise.

Investment Business Agencies and Introductions
R331.17

When considering referrals of investment business (‘introductions’) or the
establishment of investment business agencies, professional accountants shall apply
the general principles and requirements set out above.

331.17 A1

Additional considerations will include:
•

Whether the introduction or agency is permitted by regulation; and

•

Whether the status of the third party investment business provider is compatible with
the requirement to give objective advice.

Regulated activities under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (United Kingdom)
331.18 A1

In order to make a decision about whether an introduction is a regulated activity, a professional
accountant must look at how the introduction is made and also what type of investment the
SECTION 331 Page 81 of 226

THE CODE

client is considering (such as life assurance and pensions, unit trusts, shares, mortgages or
general insurance). A regulated introduction can only be made under the terms of the Act by a
firm which is licensed by ICAEW as a Designated Professional Body (‘DPB’) (a licensed firm)
or a firm which is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (‘authorised’). Unauthorised /
unlicensed firms are restricted in that they can only make introductions for general financial
advice where no specific type of investment is referred to, or for a restricted range of
investments, such as shares and unit trusts. Further guidance can be found in the DPB
Handbook.
R331.19

Having established that an introduction can be made in compliance with regulatory
requirements, professional accountants shall bear in mind the need to provide their
clients with objective advice, in compliance with these ethical standards.

R331.20

Professional accountants might become appointed representatives of another
authorised firm. When selecting which authorised firm to become an appointed
representative of, professional accountants shall again bear in mind the need to provide
their clients with objective advice.

Status of Investment Business Providers
331.23 A1

Considerations in implementing the above requirements when becoming an agent of an
authorised firm are summarised below.
Authorised firms within the
United Kingdom may fall into
the following categories:

What recommendations the
firm may make

May there generally be
introductions to this type of
firm?

Independent

A firm provides independent
advice across all markets
and all retail investment
products

Yes (331.24 A1 below)

Restricted

A firm provides independent
advice in respect of a
relevant market that does
not
include
all
retail
investment products (but
does include all retail
investment products within
the relevant market)

Depends (R331.25 below)

Type of firm

A firm provides restricted
advice (being advice which
is not as described above)

Depends on scope of choice
(R331.26 below)

Further information and the definitions of independent and restricted is available in the FCA
Handbook.

SECTION 331 Page 82 of 226

THE CODE

331.24 A1

An introduction to independent firms (category (a) only for the UK table above) would be likely
to meet the requirement to give objective advice but professional accountants are reminded of
the general requirements above.

R331.25

Professional accountants shall apply the guidance in Sections 331.1 to 331.8. in respect
of recommendations to firms providing independent advice in respect of a relevant
market that does not include all retail investment products.

331.25 A1

Whether they can make such recommendations will depend upon whether the relevant markets
covered are appropriate to the client’s requirements and on whether, within those markets, the
firm places business with the product providers who account for a large majority of the relevant
market or offer the sector of the market which is most suitable for the client’s needs. The latter
aspect is discussed further in 331.27 A1 below in the context of restricted advice but similar
principles apply.

R331.26

If considering an introduction to a restricted firm, professional accountants shall apply
the guidance in 331.1 to 331.8 above. professional accountants shall assess the client’s
requirements and whether the restricted firm places business with the product
providers who account for a large majority of the relevant market or offer the sector of
the market which is most suitable for the client’s needs. If making such a referral, the
professional accountant shall make the client aware of restrictions in the range of
investments offered by the firm to which the client is being referred.

331.26 A1

Professional accountants may in some situations be able to introduce to restricted firms and
still comply with the ethical requirements (however, see 331.18 A1 and R331.19 above as to
whether the introduction can only be made by a DPB licensed firm or an FCA authorised firm,
if it is a ‘regulated’ activity). Whether an introduction to a restricted firm will be acceptable will
depend on the particular circumstances and the scope of the available choice. The principal
threat is that clients might not be offered the most appropriate choice. However, professional
accountants need to ensure that in making such an assessment, they are not effectively making
their own recommendation unless they are able to do so under the terms of a licence or
authorisation. The professional accountant may decide that this does not restrict the client’s
access to the range of product providers to an extent where there is any potential detriment.

331.27 A1

Similar considerations to those noted above apply to whether a professional accountant shall
become an appointed representative under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Thus,
for example, a professional firm cannot become an appointed representative for regulated
investment business, of a restricted firm if the agency agreement would obliged the firm to
make referrals to the principal in all circumstances and the firm would be unable to provide
objective advice.

SECTION 340
INDUCEMENTS, INCLUDING GIFTS AND HOSPITALITY
Introduction
340.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

340.2

Offering or accepting inducements might create a self-interest, familiarity or intimidation threat to
compliance with the fundamental principles, particularly the principles of integrity, objectivity and
professional behaviour.

340.3

This section sets out requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual
framework in relation to the offering and accepting of inducements when performing professional
services that does not constitute non-compliance with laws and regulations. This section also
requires a professional accountant to comply with relevant laws and regulations when offering or
accepting inducements.

Requirements and Application Material
General
340.4 A1

An inducement is an object, situation, or action that is used as a means to influence another
individual’s behaviour, but not necessarily with the intent to improperly influence that individual’s
behaviour. inducements can range from minor acts of hospitality between professional
accountants and existing or prospective clients to acts that result in non-compliance with laws
and regulations. An inducement can take many different forms, for example:
•

Gifts.

•

Hospitality.

•

Entertainment.

•

Political or charitable donations.

•

Appeals to friendship and loyalty.

•

Employment or other commercial opportunities.

•

Preferential treatment, rights or privileges.

Inducements Prohibited by Laws and Regulations
R340.5

In many jurisdictions, there are laws and regulations, such as those related to bribery and
corruption, that prohibit the offering or accepting of inducements in certain circumstances. The
professional accountant shall obtain an understanding of relevant laws and regulations and
comply with them when the accountant encounters such circumstances.

Inducements Not Prohibited by Laws and Regulations
340.6 A1

The offering or accepting of inducements that is not prohibited by laws and regulations might still
create threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.

Inducements with Intent to Improperly Influence Behaviour
R340.7

A professional accountant shall not offer, or encourage others to offer, any inducement that is
made, or which the accountant considers a reasonable and informed third party would be likely
to conclude is made, with the intent to improperly influence the behaviour of the recipient or of
another individual.

R340.8

A professional accountant shall not accept, or encourage others to accept, any inducement that
the accountant concludes is made, or considers a reasonable and informed third party would be
likely to conclude is made, with the intent to improperly influence the behaviour of the recipient
or of another individual.

340.9 A1

An inducement is considered as improperly influencing an individual’s behaviour if it causes the
individual to act in an unethical manner. Such improper influence can be directed either towards
the recipient or towards another individual who has some relationship with the recipient. The
SECTION 340 Page 84 of 226

THE CODE

fundamental principles are an appropriate frame of reference for a professional accountant in
considering what constitutes unethical behaviour on the part of the accountant and, if necessary
by analogy, other individuals.
340.9 A2

A breach of the fundamental principle of integrity arises when a professional accountant offers
or accepts, or encourages others to offer or accept, an inducement where the intent is to
improperly influence the behaviour of the recipient or of another individual.

340.9 A3

The determination of whether there is actual or perceived intent to improperly influence behaviour
requires the exercise of professional judgement. Relevant factors to consider might include:
•

The nature, frequency, value and cumulative effect of the inducement.

•

Timing of when the inducement is offered relative to any action or decision that it might
influence.

•

Whether the inducement is a customary or cultural practice in the circumstances, for
example, offering a gift on the occasion of a religious holiday or wedding.

•

Whether the inducement is an ancillary part of a professional service, for example, offering
or accepting lunch in connection with a business meeting.

•

Whether the offer of the inducement is limited to an individual recipient or available to a
broader group. The broader group might be internal or external to the firm, such as other
suppliers to the client.

•

The roles and positions of the individuals at the firm or the client offering or being offered
the inducement.

•

Whether the professional accountant knows, or has reason to believe, that accepting the
inducement would breach the policies and procedures of the client.

•

The degree of transparency with which the inducement is offered.

•

Whether the inducement was required or requested by the recipient.

•

The known previous behaviour or reputation of the offeror.

Consideration of Further Actions
340.10 A1

If the professional accountant becomes aware of an inducement offered with actual or perceived
intent to improperly influence behaviour, threats to compliance with the fundamental principles
might still be created even if the requirements in paragraphs R340.7 and R340.8 are met.

340.10 A2

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:
•

Informing senior management of the firm or those charged with governance of the client
regarding the offer.

•

Amending or terminating the business relationship with the client.

Inducements with No Intent to Improperly Influence Behaviour
340.11 A1

The requirements and application material set out in the conceptual framework apply when a
professional accountant has concluded there is no actual or perceived intent to improperly
influence the behaviour of the recipient or of another individual.

340.11 A2

If such an inducement is trivial and inconsequential, any threats created will be at an acceptable
level.

340.11 A3

Examples of circumstances where offering or accepting such an inducement might create threats
even if the professional accountant has concluded there is no actual or perceived intent to
improperly influence behaviour include:
•

Self-interest threats
o

A professional accountant is offered hospitality from the prospective acquirer of a
client while providing corporate finance services to the client.

SECTION 340 Page 85 of 226

THE CODE

•

Familiarity threats
o

•

A professional accountant regularly takes an existing or prospective client to sporting
events.

Intimidation threats
o

A professional accountant accepts hospitality from a client, the nature of which could
be perceived to be inappropriate were it to be publicly disclosed.

340.11 A4

Relevant factors in evaluating the level of such threats created by offering or accepting such an
inducement include the same factors set out in paragraph 340.9 A3 for determining intent.

340.11 A5

Examples of actions that might eliminate threats created by offering or accepting such an
inducement include:

340.11 A6

•

Declining or not offering the inducement.

•

Transferring responsibility for the provision of any professional services to the client to
another individual who the professional accountant has no reason to believe would be, or
would be perceived to be, improperly influenced when providing the services.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats created by offering or
accepting such an inducement include:
•

Being transparent with senior management of the firm or of the client about offering or
accepting an inducement.

•

Registering the inducement in a log monitored by senior management of the firm or another
individual responsible for the firm’s ethics compliance or maintained by the client.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer, who is not otherwise involved in providing the professional
service, review any work performed or decisions made by the professional accountant with
respect to the client from which the accountant accepted the inducement.

•

Donating the inducement to charity after receipt and appropriately disclosing the donation,
for example, to a member of senior management of the firm or the individual who offered
the inducement.

•

Reimbursing the cost of the inducement, such as hospitality, received.

•

As soon as possible, returning the inducement, such as a gift, after it was initially accepted.

Immediate or Close Family Members
R340.12

A professional accountant shall remain alert to potential threats to the accountant’s compliance
with the fundamental principles created by the offering of an inducement:
(a)

By an immediate or close family member of the accountant to an existing or prospective
client of the accountant.

(b)

To an immediate or close family member of the accountant by an existing or prospective
client of the accountant.

R340.13

Where the professional accountant becomes aware of an inducement being offered to or made
by an immediate or close family member and concludes there is intent to improperly influence
the behaviour of the accountant or of an existing or prospective client of the accountant, or
considers a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude such intent exists,
the accountant shall advise the immediate or close family member not to offer or accept the
inducement.

340.13 A1

The factors set out in paragraph 340.9 A3 are relevant in determining whether there is actual or
perceived intent to improperly influence the behaviour of the professional accountant or of the
existing or prospective client. Another factor that is relevant is the nature or closeness of the
relationship, between:
(a)

The accountant and the immediate or close family member;

(b)

The immediate or close family member and the existing or prospective client; and

(c)

The accountant and the existing or prospective client.

SECTION 340 Page 86 of 226

THE CODE

For example, the offer of employment, outside of the normal recruitment process, to the spouse
of the accountant by a client for whom the accountant is providing a business valuation for a
prospective sale might indicate such intent.
340.13 A2

The application material in paragraph 340.10 A2 is also relevant in addressing threats that might
be created when there is actual or perceived intent to improperly influence the behaviour of the
professional accountant, or of the existing or prospective client even if the immediate or close
family member has followed the advice given pursuant to paragraph R340.13.

Application of the Conceptual Framework
340.14 A1

340.14 A2

Where the professional accountant becomes aware of an inducement offered in the
circumstances addressed in paragraph R340.12, threats to compliance with the fundamental
principles might be created where:
(a)

The immediate or close family member offers or accepts the inducement contrary to the
advice of the accountant pursuant to paragraph R340.13; or

(b)

The accountant does not have reason to believe an actual or perceived intent to improperly
influence the behaviour of the accountant or of the existing or prospective client exists.

The application material in paragraphs 340.11 A1 to 340.11 A6 is relevant for the purposes of
identifying, evaluating and addressing such threats. Factors that are relevant in evaluating the
level of threats in these circumstances also include the nature or closeness of the relationships
set out in paragraph 340.13 A1.

Other Considerations
340.15 A1

If a professional accountant encounters or is made aware of inducements that might result in
non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations by a client or individuals
working for or under the direction of the client, the requirements and application material in
Section 360 apply.

340.15 A2

If a firm, network firm or an audit team member is being offered gifts or hospitality from an audit
client, the requirement and application material set out in Section 420 apply.

340.15 A3

If a firm or an assurance team member is being offered gifts or hospitality from an assurance
client, the requirement and application material set out in Section 906 apply.

CUSTODY OF CLIENT ASSETS
Introduction
350.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

350.2

Holding client assets creates a self-interest or other threat to compliance with the principles of
professional behaviour and objectivity. This section sets out specific requirements and
application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
Before Taking Custody
R350.3

A professional accountant shall not assume custody of client money or other assets unless
permitted to do so by law and in accordance with any conditions under which such custody may
be taken.

R350.4

As part of client and engagement acceptance procedures related to assuming custody of client
money or assets, a professional accountant shall:

350.4 A1

(a)

Make inquiries about the source of the assets; and

(b)

Consider related legal and regulatory obligations.

Inquiries about the source of client assets might reveal, for example, that the assets were derived
from illegal activities, such as money laundering. In such circumstances, a threat would be
created and the provisions of Section 360 would apply.

After Taking Custody
R350.5

A professional accountant entrusted with money or other assets belonging to others shall:
(a)

Comply with the laws and regulations relevant to holding and accounting for the assets;

(b)

Keep the assets separately from personal or firm assets;

(c)

Use the assets only for the purpose for which they are intended; and

(d)

Be ready at all times to account for the assets and any income, dividends, or gains
generated, to any individuals entitled to that accounting.

Professional accountants should also refer to the latest versions of the following sources of information:

SECTION 360
RESPONDING TO NON-COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Introduction
360.1

Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.

360.2

A self-interest or intimidation threat to compliance with the principles of integrity and professional
behaviour is created when a professional accountant becomes aware of non-compliance or
suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations.

360.3

A professional accountant might encounter or be made aware of non-compliance or suspected
non-compliance in the course of providing a professional service to a client. This section guides
the accountant in assessing the implications of the matter and the possible courses of action
when responding to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with:
(a)

Laws and regulations generally recognised to have a direct effect on the determination of
material amounts and disclosures in the client’s financial statements; and

(b)

Other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the determination of the
amounts and disclosures in the client’s financial statements, but compliance with which
might be fundamental to the operating aspects of the client’s business, to its ability to
continue its business, or to avoid material penalties.

Objectives of the Professional Accountant in Relation to Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations
360.4

A distinguishing mark of the accountancy profession is its acceptance of the responsibility to act
in the public interest. When responding to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the
objectives of the professional accountant are:
(a)

To comply with the principles of integrity and professional behaviour;

(b)

By alerting management or, where appropriate, those charged with governance of the
client, to seek to:

(c)

(i)

Enable them to rectify, remediate or mitigate the consequences of the identified or
suspected non-compliance; or

(ii)

Deter the commission of the non-compliance where it has not yet occurred; and

To take such further action as appropriate in the public interest.

Requirements and Application Material
General
360.5 A1

360.5 A2

Non-compliance with laws and regulations (“non-compliance”) comprises acts of omission or
commission, intentional or unintentional, which are contrary to the prevailing laws or regulations
committed by the following parties:
(a)

A client;

(b)

Those charged with governance of a client;

(c)

Management of a client; or

(d)

Other individuals working for or under the direction of a client.

Examples of laws and regulations which this section addresses include those that deal with:
•

Fraud, corruption and bribery.

•

Money laundering, terrorist financing and proceeds of crime.

•

Securities markets and trading.

•

Banking and other financial products and services.

•

Data protection.

•

Tax and pension liabilities and payments.

SECTION 360 Page 89 of 226

THE CODE

•

Environmental protection.

•

Public health and safety.

360.5 A3

Non-compliance might result in fines, litigation or other consequences for the client, potentially
materially affecting its financial statements. Importantly, such non-compliance might have wider
public interest implications in terms of potentially substantial harm to investors, creditors,
employees or the general public. For the purposes of this section, an act that causes substantial
harm is one that results in serious adverse consequences to any of these parties in financial or
non-financial terms. Examples include the perpetration of a fraud resulting in significant financial
losses to investors, and breaches of environmental laws and regulations endangering the health
or safety of employees or the public.

R360.6

In some jurisdictions, there are legal or regulatory provisions governing how professional
accountants should address non-compliance or suspected non-compliance. These legal or
regulatory provisions might differ from or go beyond the provisions in this section. When
encountering such non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant shall obtain
an understanding of those legal or regulatory provisions and comply with them, including:
(a)

Any requirement to report the matter to an appropriate authority; and

(b)

Any prohibition on alerting the client.

360.6 A1

A prohibition on alerting the client might arise, for example, pursuant to anti-money laundering
legislation.

360.7 A1

This section applies regardless of the nature of the client, including whether or not it is a public
interest entity.

360.7 A2

A professional accountant who encounters or is made aware of matters that are clearly
inconsequential is not required to comply with this section. Whether a matter is clearly
inconsequential is to be judged with respect to its nature and its impact, financial or otherwise,
on the client, its stakeholders and the general public.

360.7 A3

This section does not address:
(a)

Personal misconduct unrelated to the business activities of the client; and

(b)

Non-compliance by parties other than those specified in paragraph 360.5 A1. This
includes, for example, circumstances where a professional accountant has been engaged
by a client to perform a due diligence assignment on a third party entity and the identified
or suspected non-compliance has been committed by that third-party.

The accountant might nevertheless find the guidance in this section helpful in considering how
to respond in these situations.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance
360.8 A1

Management, with the oversight of those charged with governance, is responsible for ensuring
that the client’s business activities are conducted in accordance with laws and regulations.
Management and those charged with governance are also responsible for identifying and
addressing any non-compliance by:
(a)

The client;

(b)

An individual charged with governance of the entity;

(c)

A member of management; or

(d)

Other individuals working for or under the direction of the client.

Responsibilities of All Professional Accountants
R360.9

Where a professional accountant becomes aware of a matter to which this section applies, the
steps that the accountant takes to comply with this section shall be taken on a timely basis. In
taking timely steps, the accountant shall have regard to the nature of the matter and the potential
harm to the interests of the entity, investors, creditors, employees or the general public.

SECTION 360 Page 90 of 226

THE CODE

Audits of Financial Statements
Obtaining an Understanding of the Matter
R360.10

If a professional accountant engaged to perform an audit of financial statements becomes aware
of information concerning non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant shall
obtain an understanding of the matter. This understanding shall include the nature of the noncompliance or suspected non-compliance and the circumstances in which it has occurred or
might occur.

360.10 A1

The professional accountant might become aware of the non-compliance or suspected noncompliance in the course of performing the engagement or through information provided by other
parties.

360.10 A2

The professional accountant is expected to apply knowledge and expertise, and exercise
professional judgement. However, the accountant is not expected to have a level of knowledge
of laws and regulations greater than that which is required to undertake the engagement.
Whether an act constitutes non-compliance is ultimately a matter to be determined by a court or
other appropriate adjudicative body.

360.10 A3

Depending on the nature and significance of the matter, the professional accountant might
consult on a confidential basis with others within the firm, a network firm or a professional body,
or with legal counsel.

R360.11

If the professional accountant identifies or suspects that non-compliance has occurred or might
occur, the accountant shall discuss the matter with the appropriate level of management and,
where appropriate, those charged with governance.

360.11 A1

The purpose of the discussion is to clarify the professional accountant’s understanding of the
facts and circumstances relevant to the matter and its potential consequences. The discussion
also might prompt management or those charged with governance to investigate the matter.

360.11 A2

The appropriate level of management with whom to discuss the matter is a question of
professional judgement. Relevant factors to consider include:
•

The nature and circumstances of the matter.

•

The individuals actually or potentially involved.

•

The likelihood of collusion.

•

The potential consequences of the matter.

•

Whether that level of management is able to investigate the matter and take appropriate
action.

360.11 A3

The appropriate level of management is usually at least one level above the individual or
individuals involved or potentially involved in the matter. In the context of a group, the appropriate
level might be management at an entity that controls the client.

360.11 A4

The professional accountant might also consider discussing the matter with internal auditors,
where applicable.

R360.12

If the professional accountant believes that management is involved in the non-compliance or
suspected non-compliance, the accountant shall discuss the matter with those charged with
governance.

Addressing the Matter
R360.13

R360.14

In discussing the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with management and, where
appropriate, those charged with governance, the professional accountant shall advise them to
take appropriate and timely actions, if they have not already done so, to:
(a)

Rectify, remediate or mitigate the consequences of the non-compliance;

(b)

Deter the commission of the non-compliance where it has not yet occurred; or

(c)

Disclose the matter to an appropriate authority where required by law or regulation or
where considered necessary in the public interest.

The professional accountant shall consider whether management and those charged with
governance understand their legal or regulatory responsibilities with respect to the noncompliance or suspected non-compliance.
SECTION 360 Page 91 of 226

THE CODE

360.14 A1

If management and those charged with governance do not understand their legal or regulatory
responsibilities with respect to the matter, the professional accountant might suggest appropriate
sources of information or recommend that they obtain legal advice.

R360.15

The professional accountant shall comply with applicable:

360.15 A1

(a)

Laws and regulations, including legal or regulatory provisions governing the reporting of
non-compliance or suspected non-compliance to an appropriate authority; and

(b)

Requirements under auditing standards, including those relating to:
•

Identifying and responding to non-compliance, including fraud.

•

Communicating with those charged with governance.

•

Considering the implications of the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance
for the auditor’s report.

Some laws and regulations might stipulate a period within which reports of non-compliance or
suspected non-compliance are to be made to an appropriate authority.

Communication with Respect to Groups
R360.16

Where a professional accountant becomes aware of non-compliance or suspected noncompliance in either of the following two situations in the context of a group, the accountant shall
communicate the matter to the group engagement partner unless prohibited from doing so by law
or regulation:
(a)

The accountant performs audit work related to a component for purposes of the group
audit; or

(b)

The accountant is engaged to perform an audit of the financial statements of a legal entity
or business unit that is part of a group for purposes other than the group audit, for example,
a statutory audit.

The communication to the group engagement partner shall be in addition to responding to the
matter in accordance with the provisions of this section.
360.16 A1

The purpose of the communication is to enable the group engagement partner to be informed
about the matter and to determine, in the context of the group audit, whether and, if so, how to
address it in accordance with the provisions in this section. The communication requirement in
paragraph R360.16 applies regardless of whether the group engagement partner’s firm or network
is the same as or different from the professional accountant’s firm or network.

R360.17

Where the group engagement partner becomes aware of non-compliance or suspected noncompliance in the course of a group audit, the group engagement partner shall consider whether
the matter might be relevant to:
(a)

One or more components subject to audit work for purposes of the group audit; or

(b)

One or more legal entities or business units that are part of the group and whose financial
statements are subject to audit for purposes other than the group audit, for example, a
statutory audit.

This consideration shall be in addition to responding to the matter in the context of the group
audit in accordance with the provisions of this section.
R360.18

If the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance might be relevant to one or more of the
components specified in paragraph R360.17(a) and legal entities or business units specified in
paragraph R360.17(b), the group engagement partner shall take steps to have the matter
communicated to those performing audit work at the components, legal entities or business units,
unless prohibited from doing so by law or regulation. If necessary, the group engagement partner
shall arrange for appropriate inquiries to be made (either of management or from publicly
available information) as to whether the relevant legal entities or business units specified in
paragraph R360.17(b) are subject to audit and, if so, to ascertain to the extent practicable the
identity of the auditors.

360.18 A1

The purpose of the communication is to enable those responsible for audit work at the
components, legal entities or business units to be informed about the matter and to determine
whether and, if so, how to address it in accordance with the provisions in this section. The
SECTION 360 Page 92 of 226

THE CODE

communication requirement applies regardless of whether the group engagement partner’s firm
or network is the same as or different from the firms or networks of those performing audit work
at the components, legal entities or business units.
Determining Whether Further Action Is Needed
R360.19

The professional accountant shall assess the appropriateness of the response of management
and, where applicable, those charged with governance.

360.19 A1

Relevant factors to consider in assessing the appropriateness of the response of management
and, where applicable, those charged with governance include whether:
•

The response is timely.

•

The non-compliance or suspected non-compliance has been adequately investigated.

•

Action has been, or is being, taken to rectify, remediate or mitigate the consequences of
any non-compliance.

•

Action has been, or is being, taken to deter the commission of any non-compliance where
it has not yet occurred.

•

Appropriate steps have been, or are being, taken to reduce the risk of re-occurrence, for
example, additional controls or training.

•

The non-compliance or suspected non-compliance has been disclosed to an appropriate
authority where appropriate and, if so, whether the disclosure appears adequate.

R360.20

In light of the response of management and, where applicable, those charged with governance,
the professional accountant shall determine if further action is needed in the public interest.

360.20 A1

The determination of whether further action is needed, and the nature and extent of it, will depend
on various factors, including:

360.20 A2

•

The legal and regulatory framework.

•

The urgency of the situation.

•

The pervasiveness of the matter throughout the client.

•

Whether the professional accountant continues to have confidence in the integrity of
management and, where applicable, those charged with governance.

•

Whether the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance is likely to recur.

•

Whether there is credible evidence of actual or potential substantial harm to the interests
of the entity, investors, creditors, employees or the general public.

Examples of circumstances that might cause the professional accountant no longer to have
confidence in the integrity of management and, where applicable, those charged with governance
include situations where:
•

The accountant suspects or has evidence of their involvement or intended involvement in
any non-compliance.

•

The accountant is aware that they have knowledge of such non-compliance and, contrary
to legal or regulatory requirements, have not reported, or authorised the reporting of, the
matter to an appropriate authority within a reasonable period.

R360.21

The professional accountant shall exercise professional judgement in determining the need for,
and nature and extent of, further action. In making this determination, the accountant shall take
into account whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that the
accountant has acted appropriately in the public interest.

360.21 A1

Further action that the professional accountant might take includes:

360.21 A2

•

Disclosing the matter to an appropriate authority even when there is no legal or regulatory
requirement to do so.

•

Withdrawing from the engagement and the professional relationship where permitted by
law or regulation.

Withdrawing from the engagement and the professional relationship is not a substitute for taking
other actions that might be needed to achieve the professional accountant’s objectives under this
SECTION 360 Page 93 of 226

THE CODE

section. In some jurisdictions, however, there might be limitations as to the further actions
available to the accountant. In such circumstances, withdrawal might be the only available course
of action.
R360.22

Where the professional accountant has withdrawn from the professional relationship pursuant to
paragraphs R360.20 and 360.21 A1, the accountant shall, on request by the proposed
accountant pursuant to paragraph R320.8, provide all relevant facts and other information
concerning the identified or suspected non-compliance to the proposed accountant. The
predecessor accountant shall do so, even in the circumstances addressed in paragraph
R320.8(b) where the client fails or refuses to grant the predecessor accountant permission to
discuss the client’s affairs with the proposed accountant, unless prohibited by law or regulation.

360.22 A1

The facts and other information to be provided are those that, in the predecessor accountant’s
opinion, the proposed accountant needs to be aware of before deciding whether to accept the
audit appointment. Section 320 addresses communications from proposed accountants.

R360.23

If the proposed accountant is unable to communicate with the predecessor accountant, the
proposed accountant shall take reasonable steps to obtain information about the circumstances
of the change of appointment by other means.

360.23 A1

Other means to obtain information about the circumstances of the change of appointment include
inquiries of third parties or background investigations of management or those charged with
governance.

360.24 A1

As assessment of the matter might involve complex analysis and judgements, the professional
accountant might consider:
•

Consulting internally.

•

Obtaining legal advice to understand the accountant’s options and the professional or legal
implications of taking any particular course of action.

•

Consulting on a confidential basis with a regulatory or professional body.

Determining Whether to Disclose the Matter to an Appropriate Authority
360.25 A1

Disclosure of the matter to an appropriate authority would be precluded if doing so would be
contrary to law or regulation. Otherwise, the purpose of making disclosure is to enable an
appropriate authority to cause the matter to be investigated and action to be taken in the public
interest.

360.25 A2

The determination of whether to make such a disclosure depends in particular on the nature and
extent of the actual or potential harm that is or might be caused by the matter to investors,
creditors, employees or the general public. For example, the professional accountant might
determine that disclosure of the matter to an appropriate authority is an appropriate course of
action if:

360.25 A3

•

The entity is engaged in bribery (for example, of local or foreign government officials for
purposes of securing large contracts).

•

The entity is regulated and the matter is of such significance as to threaten its license to
operate.

•

The entity is listed on a securities exchange and the matter might result in adverse
consequences to the fair and orderly market in the entity’s securities or pose a systemic
risk to the financial markets.

•

It is likely that the entity would sell products that are harmful to public health or safety.

•

The entity is promoting a scheme to its clients to assist them in evading taxes.

The determination of whether to make such a disclosure will also depend on external factors
such as:
•

Whether there is an appropriate authority that is able to receive the information, and cause
the matter to be investigated and action to be taken. The appropriate authority will depend
on the nature of the matter. For example, the appropriate authority would be a securities
regulator in the case of fraudulent financial reporting or an environmental protection
agency in the case of a breach of environmental laws and regulations.

SECTION 360 Page 94 of 226

THE CODE

R360.26

•

Whether there exists robust and credible protection from civil, criminal or professional
liability or retaliation afforded by legislation or regulation, such as under whistle-blowing
legislation or regulation.

•

Whether there are actual or potential threats to the physical safety of the professional
accountant or other individuals.

If the professional accountant determines that disclosure of the non-compliance or suspected
non-compliance to an appropriate authority is an appropriate course of action in the
circumstances, that disclosure is permitted pursuant to paragraph R114.3 of the Code. When
making such disclosure, the accountant shall act in good faith and exercise caution when making
statements and assertions. The accountant shall also consider whether it is appropriate to inform
the client of the accountant’s intentions before disclosing the matter.

Imminent Breach
R360.27

In exceptional circumstances, the professional accountant might become aware of actual or
intended conduct that the accountant has reason to believe would constitute an imminent breach
of a law or regulation that would cause substantial harm to investors, creditors, employees or the
general public. Having first considered whether it would be appropriate to discuss the matter with
management or those charged with governance of the entity, the accountant shall exercise
professional judgement and determine whether to disclose the matter immediately to an
appropriate authority in order to prevent or mitigate the consequences of such imminent breach.
If disclosure is made, that disclosure is permitted pursuant to paragraph R114.3 of the Code.

Documentation
R360.28

360.28 A1

In relation to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance that falls within the scope of this
section, the professional accountant shall document:
•

How management and, where applicable, those charged with governance have responded
to the matter.

•

The courses of action the accountant considered, the judgements made and the decisions
that were taken, having regard to the reasonable and informed third party test.

•

How the accountant is satisfied that the accountant has fulfilled the responsibility set out
in paragraph R360.20.

This documentation is in addition to complying with the documentation requirements under
applicable auditing standards. ISAs, for example, require a professional accountant performing
an audit of financial statements to:
•

Prepare documentation sufficient to enable an understanding of significant matters arising
during the audit, the conclusions reached, and significant professional judgements made
in reaching those conclusions;

•

Document discussions of significant matters with management, those charged with
governance, and others, including the nature of the significant matters discussed and when
and with whom the discussions took place; and

•

Document identified or suspected non-compliance, and the results of discussion with
management and, where applicable, those charged with governance and other parties
outside the entity.

Professional Services Other than Audits of Financial Statements
Obtaining an Understanding of the Matter and Addressing It with Management and Those Charged with
Governance
R360.29

If a professional accountant engaged to provide a professional service other than an audit of
financial statements becomes aware of information concerning non-compliance or suspected
non-compliance, the accountant shall seek to obtain an understanding of the matter. This
understanding shall include the nature of the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance and
the circumstances in which it has occurred or might be about to occur.

360.29 A1

The professional accountant is expected to apply knowledge and expertise, and exercise
professional judgement. However, the accountant is not expected to have a level of
understanding of laws and regulations beyond that which is required for the professional service
SECTION 360 Page 95 of 226

THE CODE

for which the accountant was engaged. Whether an act constitutes actual non-compliance is
ultimately a matter to be determined by a court or other appropriate adjudicative body.
360.29 A2

Depending on the nature and significance of the matter, the professional accountant might
consult on a confidential basis with others within the firm, a network firm or a professional body,
or with legal counsel.

R360.30

If the professional accountant identifies or suspects that non-compliance has occurred or might
occur, the accountant shall discuss the matter with the appropriate level of management. If the
accountant has access to those charged with governance, the accountant shall also discuss the
matter with them where appropriate.

360.30 A1

The purpose of the discussion is to clarify the professional accountant’s understanding of the
facts and circumstances relevant to the matter and its potential consequences. The discussion
also might prompt management or those charged with governance to investigate the matter.

360.30 A2

The appropriate level of management with whom to discuss the matter is a question of
professional judgement. Relevant factors to consider include:
•

The nature and circumstances of the matter.

•

The individuals actually or potentially involved.

•

The likelihood of collusion.

•

The potential consequences of the matter.

•

Whether that level of management is able to investigate the matter and take appropriate
action.

Communicating the Matter to the Entity’s External Auditor
R360.31

If the professional accountant is performing a non-audit service for:
(a)

An audit client of the firm; or

(b)

A component of an audit client of the firm,

the accountant shall communicate the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance within the
firm, unless prohibited from doing so by law or regulation. The communication shall be made in
accordance with the firm’s protocols or procedures. In the absence of such protocols and
procedures, it shall be made directly to the audit engagement partner.
R360.32

If the professional accountant is performing a non-audit service for:
(a)

An audit client of a network firm; or

(b)

A component of an audit client of a network firm,

the accountant shall consider whether to communicate the non-compliance or suspected noncompliance to the network firm. Where the communication is made, it shall be made in
accordance with the network’s protocols or procedures. In the absence of such protocols and
procedures, it shall be made directly to the audit engagement partner.
R360.33

If the professional accountant is performing a non-audit service for a client that is not:
(a)

An audit client of the firm or a network firm; or

(b)

A component of an audit client of the firm or a network firm,

the accountant shall consider whether to communicate the non-compliance or suspected noncompliance to the firm that is the client’s external auditor, if any.
Relevant Factors to Consider
360.34 A1

Factors relevant to considering the communication in accordance with paragraphs R360.31 to
R360.33 include:
•

Whether doing so would be contrary to law or regulation.

•

Whether there are restrictions about disclosure imposed by a regulatory agency or
prosecutor in an ongoing investigation into the non-compliance or suspected noncompliance.
SECTION 360 Page 96 of 226

THE CODE

•

Whether the purpose of the engagement is to investigate potential non-compliance within
the entity to enable it to take appropriate action.

•

Whether management or those charged with governance have already informed the
entity’s external auditor about the matter.

•

The likely materiality of the matter to the audit of the client’s financial statements or, where
the matter relates to a component of a group, its likely materiality to the audit of the group
financial statements.

Purpose of Communication
360.35 A1

In the circumstances addressed in paragraphs R360.31 to R360.33, the purpose of the
communication is to enable the audit engagement partner to be informed about the noncompliance or suspected non-compliance and to determine whether and, if so, how to address
it in accordance with the provisions of this section.

Considering Whether Further Action Is Needed
R360.36

The professional accountant shall also consider whether further action is needed in the public
interest.

360.36 A1

Whether further action is needed, and the nature and extent of it, will depend on factors such as:

360.36 A2

360.36 A3

R360.37

•

The legal and regulatory framework.

•

The appropriateness and timeliness of the response of management and, where
applicable, those charged with governance.

•

The urgency of the situation.

•

The involvement of management or those charged with governance in the matter.

•

The likelihood of substantial harm to the interests of the client, investors, creditors,
employees or the general public.

Further action by the professional accountant might include:
•

Disclosing the matter to an appropriate authority even when there is no legal or regulatory
requirement to do so.

•

Withdrawing from the engagement and the professional relationship where permitted by
law or regulation.

In considering whether to disclose to an appropriate authority, relevant factors to take into
account include:
•

Whether doing so would be contrary to law or regulation.

•

Whether there are restrictions about disclosure imposed by a regulatory agency or
prosecutor in an ongoing investigation into the non-compliance or suspected noncompliance.

•

Whether the purpose of the engagement is to investigate potential non-compliance within
the entity to enable it to take appropriate action.

If the professional accountant determines that disclosure of the non-compliance or suspected
non-compliance to an appropriate authority is an appropriate course of action in the
circumstances, that disclosure is permitted pursuant to paragraph R114.3 of the Code. When
making such disclosure, the accountant shall act in good faith and exercise caution when making
statements and assertions. The accountant shall also consider whether it is appropriate to inform
the client of the accountant’s intentions before disclosing the matter.

Imminent Breach
R360.38

In exceptional circumstances, the professional accountant might become aware of actual or
intended conduct that the accountant has reason to believe would constitute an imminent breach
of a law or regulation that would cause substantial harm to investors, creditors, employees or the
general public. Having first considered whether it would be appropriate to discuss the matter with
management or those charged with governance of the entity, the accountant shall exercise
professional judgement and determine whether to disclose the matter immediately to an
appropriate authority in order to prevent or mitigate the consequences of such imminent breach
SECTION 360 Page 97 of 226

THE CODE

of law or regulation. If disclosure is made, that disclosure is permitted pursuant to paragraph
R114.3 of the Code.
Seeking Advice
360.39 A1

The professional accountant might consider:
•

Consulting internally.

•

Obtaining legal advice to understand the professional or legal implications of taking any
particular course of action.

•

Consulting on a confidential basis with a regulatory or professional body.

Documentation
360.40 A1

In relation to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance that falls within the scope of this
section, the professional accountant is encouraged to document:
•

The matter.

•

The results of discussion with management and, where applicable, those charged with
governance and other parties.

•

How management and, where applicable, those charged with governance have responded
to the matter.

•

The courses of action the accountant considered, the judgements made and the decisions
that were taken.

•

How the accountant is satisfied that the accountant has fulfilled the responsibility set out
in paragraph R360.36.

PART 4A – INDEPENDENCE FOR AUDIT AND REVIEW ENGAGEMENTS
SECTION 400
APPLYING THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO INDEPENDENCE FOR AUDIT AND
REVIEW ENGAGEMENTS
Applicability of Part 4A and FRC Ethical Standard on Auditor Independence
R400.0

When conducting audit engagements in accordance with ISAs (UK), and other
public interest assurance engagements, professional accountants shall comply with
the requirements of the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standard for Auditors
(‘FRC ES’). For other audit and assurance engagements Part 4A or 4B of this Code
may apply.

400.0 A1

In accordance with UK legislation, ICAEW has adopted, as regards auditor independence
requirements for UK audits, the FRC ES. The FRC has stated, in its Scope and Authority
of Audit and Assurance Pronouncements, that the FRC ES was developed with the intent
that it should adhere to the principles of the IESBA Code. ICAEW accordingly does not
require Part 4A of this Code to be applied if the FRC ES is followed.

400.0 A2

The independence requirements to be adopted for different types of assurance
engagement, are set out below:

Part 4B of this Code.

Professional accountants should note that the Statements of Investment Circular Reporting
Standards (SIRS), issued by the FRC require compliance with relevant parts of the FRC
ES. Accordingly, any professional accountant in public practice issuing a report that states
that the work has been carried out in accordance with the SIRS will need to comply with
the independence requirements of the FRC ES.

General
400.1

It is in the public interest and required by the Code that professional accountants in public practice
be independent when performing audit or review engagements.

SECTION 400 Page 101 of 226

THE CODE

400.2

This Part applies to both audit and review engagements unless otherwise stated. The terms
“audit,” “audit team,” “audit engagement,” “audit client,” and “audit report” apply equally to review,
review team, review engagement, review client, and review engagement report.

400.3

In this Part, the term “professional accountant” refers to individual professional accountants in
public practice and their firms.

400.4

ISQM 1 requires a firm to design implement and operate a system of quality management for
audits or reviews of financial statements performed by the firm. As part of this system of quality
management, ISQM 1 requires the firm to establish quality objectives that address the fulfilment
of responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements, including those related to
independence. Under ISQM 1, relevant ethical requirements are those related to the firm, its
personnel and, when applicable, others subject to the independence requirements to which the
firm and the firm’s engagements are subject. ISAs and ISREs establish responsibilities for
engagement partners and engagement teams at the level of the engagement for audits and
reviews, respectively. The allocation of responsibilities within a firm will depend on its size,
structure and organisation. Many of the provisions of this Part do not prescribe the specific
responsibility of individuals within the firm for actions related to independence, instead referring
to “firm” for ease of reference. A firm assigns operational responsibility for compliance with
independence requirements to an individual(s) in accordance with ISQM 1. In addition, an
individual professional accountant remains responsible for compliance with any provisions that
apply to that accountant’s activities, interests or relationships.

400.5

Independence is linked to the principles of objectivity and integrity. It comprises:
(a)

Independence of mind – the state of mind that permits the expression of a conclusion
without being affected by influences that compromise professional judgement, thereby
allowing an individual to act with integrity, and exercise objectivity and professional
scepticism.

(b)

Independence in appearance – the avoidance of facts and circumstances that are so
significant that a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that a
firm’s, or an audit team member’s, integrity, objectivity or professional scepticism has been
compromised.

In this Part, references to an individual or firm being “independent” mean that the individual or firm
has complied with the provisions of this Part.
400.6

When performing audit engagements, the Code requires firms to comply with the fundamental
principles and be independent. This Part sets out specific requirements and application material
on how to apply the conceptual framework to maintain independence when performing such
engagements. The conceptual framework set out in Section 120 applies to independence as it
does to the fundamental principles set out in Section 110. Section 405 sets out specific
requirements and application material applicable in a group audit.

400.7

This Part describes:
(a)

Facts and circumstances, including professional activities, interests and relationships, that
create or might create threats to independence;

(b)

Potential actions, including safeguards, that might be appropriate to address any such
threats; and

(c)

Some situations where the threats cannot be eliminated or there can be no safeguards to
reduce them to an acceptable level.

Engagement Team and Audit Team
400.8

This Part applies to all audit team members, including engagement team members.

400.9

An engagement team for an audit engagement includes all partners and staff in the firm who
perform audit work on the engagement, and any other individuals who perform audit procedures
who are from:
(a)

A network firm; or

(b)

A firm that is not a network firm, or another service provider.

For example, an individual from a component auditor firm who performs audit procedures on the
SECTION 400 Page 102 of 226

THE CODE

financial information of a component for purposes of a group audit is a member of the
engagement team for the group audit.
400.10

In ISQM 1, a service provider includes an individual or organisation external to the firm that
provides a resource that is used in the performance of engagements. Service providers exclude
the firm, a network firm or other structures or organisations in the network.

400.11

An audit engagement might involve experts within, or engaged by, the firm, a network firm, or a
component auditor firm outside a group auditor firm’s network, who assist in the engagement.
Depending on the role of the individuals, they might be engagement team or audit team members.
For example:
•

Individuals with expertise in a specialised area of accounting or auditing who perform audit
procedures are engagement team members. These include, for example, individuals with
expertise in accounting for income taxes or in analysing complex information produced by
automated tools and techniques for the purpose of identifying unusual or unexpected
relationships.

•

Individuals within, or engaged by, the firm who have direct influence over the outcome of
the audit engagement through consultation regarding technical or industry-specific issues,
transactions or events for the engagement are audit team members but not engagement
team members.

However, individuals who are external experts are neither engagement team nor audit team
members.
400.12

If the audit engagement is subject to an engagement quality review, the engagement quality
reviewer and any other individuals performing the engagement quality review are audit team
members but not engagement team members.

Public Interest Entities
400.13

Some of the requirements and application material set out in this Part are applicable only to the
audit of financial statements of public interest entities, reflecting significant public interest in the
financial condition of these entities due to the potential impact of their financial well-being on
stakeholders.

400.14

Factors to consider in evaluating the extent of public interest in the financial condition of an entity
include:

400.15

•

The nature of the business or activities, such as taking on financial obligations to the public
as part of the entity’s primary business.

•

Whether the entity is subject to regulatory supervision designed to provide confidence that
the entity will meet its financial obligations.

•

Size of the entity.

•

The importance of the entity to the sector in which it operates including how easily
replaceable it is in the event of financial failure.

•

Number and nature of stakeholders including investors, customers, creditors and
employees.

•

The potential systemic impact on other sectors and the economy as a whole in the event
of financial failure of the entity.

Stakeholders have heightened expectations regarding the independence of a firm performing an
audit engagement for a public interest entity because of the significance of the public interest in
the financial condition of the entity. The purpose of the requirements and application material for
public interest entities as described in paragraph 400.13 is to meet these expectations, thereby
enhancing stakeholders’ confidence in the entity’s financial statements that can be used when
assessing the entity’s financial condition.

Reports that Include a Restriction on Use and Distribution
400.16

An audit report might include a restriction on use and distribution. If it does and the conditions set
out in Section 800 are met, then the independence requirements in this Part may be modified as
provided in Section 800.

SECTION 400 Page 103 of 226

THE CODE

Assurance Engagements other than Audit and Review Engagements
400.17

Independence standards for assurance engagements that are not audit or review engagements
are set out in Part 4B – Independence for Assurance Engagements Other than Audit and Review
Engagements.

Requirements and Application Material
General
R400.18

A firm performing an audit engagement shall be independent.

R400.19

A firm shall apply the conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and
address threats to independence in relation to an audit engagement.

Prohibition on Assuming Management Responsibilities
R400.20

A firm or a network firm shall not assume a management responsibility for an audit client.

400.20 A1

Management responsibilities involve controlling, leading and directing an entity, including making
decisions regarding the acquisition, deployment and control of human, financial, technological,
physical and intangible resources.

400.20 A2

When a firm or a network firm assumes a management responsibility for an audit client, selfreview, self-interest and familiarity threats are created. Assuming a management responsibility
might also create an advocacy threat because the firm or network firm becomes too closely
aligned with the views and interests of management.

400.20 A3

Determining whether an activity is a management responsibility depends on the circumstances
and requires the exercise of professional judgement. Examples of activities that would be
considered a management responsibility include:
•

Setting policies and strategic direction.

•

Hiring or dismissing employees.

•

Directing and taking responsibility for the actions of employees in relation to the
employees’ work for the entity.

•

Authorising transactions.

•

Controlling or managing bank accounts or investments.

•

Deciding which recommendations of the firm or network firm or other third parties to
implement.

•

Reporting to those charged with governance on behalf of management.

•

Taking responsibility for:
o

The preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
the applicable financial reporting framework.

o

Designing, implementing, monitoring or maintaining internal control.

400.20 A4

Subject to compliance with paragraph R400.21, providing advice and recommendations to assist
the management of an audit client in discharging its responsibilities is not assuming a
management responsibility. The provision of advice and recommendations to an audit client
might create a self-review threat and is addressed in Section 600.

R400.21

When performing a professional activity for an audit client, the firm shall be satisfied that client
management makes all judgements and decisions that are the proper responsibility of
management. This includes ensuring that the client’s management:
(a)

Designates an individual who possesses suitable skill, knowledge and experience to be
responsible at all times for the client’s decisions and to oversee the activities. Such an
individual, preferably within senior management, would understand:
(i)

The objectives, nature and results of the activities; and

(ii)

The respective client and firm or network firm responsibilities.

SECTION 400 Page 104 of 226

THE CODE

However, the individual is not required to possess the expertise to perform or re-perform
the activities.
(b)

Provides oversight of the activities and evaluates the adequacy of the results of the
activities performed for the client’s purpose.

(c)

Accepts responsibility for the actions, if any, to be taken arising from the results of the
activities.

400.21 A1 When technology is used in performing a professional activity for an audit client, the requirements
in paragraphs R400.20 and R400.21 apply regardless of the nature or extent of such use of the
technology.
Public Interest Entities
R400.22

For the purposes of this Part, a firm shall treat an entity as a public interest entity when it falls
within any of the following categories:
(a)

A publicly traded entity;

(b)

An entity one of whose main functions is to take deposits from the public;

(c)

An entity one of whose main functions is to provide insurance to the public; or

(d)

An entity specified as such by law, regulation or professional standards to meet the
purpose described in paragraph 400.15.

400.22 A1

When terms other than public interest entity are applied to entities by law, regulation or
professional standards to meet the purpose described in paragraph 400.15, such terms are
regarded as equivalent terms. However, if law, regulation or professional standards designate
entities as “public interest entities” for reasons unrelated to the purpose described in paragraph
400.15, that designation does not necessarily mean that such entities are public interest entities
for the purposes of the Code.

R400.23

In complying with the requirement in paragraph R400.22, a firm shall take into account more
explicit definitions established by law, regulation or professional standards for the categories set
out in paragraph R400.22 (a) to (c).

400.23 A1

The categories set out in paragraph R400.22 (a) to (c) are broadly defined and no recognition is
given to any size or other factors that can be relevant in a specific jurisdiction. The Code therefore
provides for those bodies responsible for setting ethics standards for professional accountants to
more explicitly define these categories by, for example:

400.23 A2

•

Making reference to specific public markets for trading securities.

•

Making reference to the local law or regulation defining banks or insurance companies.

•

Incorporating exemptions for specific types of entities, such as an entity with mutual
ownership.

•

Setting size criteria for certain types of entities.

Paragraph R400.22 (d) anticipates that those bodies responsible for setting ethics standards for
professional accountants will add categories of public interest entities to meet the purpose
described in paragraph 400.15, taking into account factors such as those set out in paragraph
400.14. Depending on the facts and circumstances in a specific jurisdiction, such categories could
include:
•

Pension funds.

•

Collective investment vehicles.

•

Private entities with large numbers of stakeholders (other than investors).

•

Not-for-profit organisations or governmental entities.

SECTION 400 Page 105 of 226

THE CODE

•
400.24 A1

Public utilities.

A firm is encouraged to determine whether to treat other entities as public interest entities for the
purposes of this Part. When making this determination, the firm might consider the factors set out
in paragraph 400.14 as well as the following factors:
•

Whether the entity is likely to become a public interest entity in the near future.

•

Whether in similar circumstances, a predecessor firm has applied independence
requirements for public interest entities to the entity.

•

Whether in similar circumstances, the firm has applied independence requirements for
public interest entities to other entities.

•

Whether the entity has been specified as not being a public interest entity by law, regulation
or professional standards.

•

Whether the entity or other stakeholders requested the firm to apply independence
requirements for public interest entities to the entity and, if so, whether there are any
reasons for not meeting this request.

•

The entity’s corporate governance arrangements, for example, whether those charged with
governance are distinct from the owners or management.

Public Disclosure – Application of Independence Requirements for Public Interest Entities
R400.25

Subject to paragraph R400.26, when a firm has applied the independence requirements for public
interest entities as described in paragraph 400.13 in performing an audit of the financial
statements of an entity, the firm shall publicly disclose that fact in a manner deemed appropriate,
taking into account the timing and accessibility of the information to stakeholders.

R400.26

As an exception to paragraph R400.25, a firm may not make such a disclosure if doing so will
result in disclosing confidential future plans of the entity.

Related Entities
R400.27

As defined, an audit client that is a publicly traded entity in accordance with paragraphs R400.22
and R400.23 includes all of its related entities. For all other entities, references to an audit client
in this Part include related entities over which the client has direct or indirect control. When the
audit team knows, or has reason to believe, that a relationship or circumstance involving any
other related entity of the client is relevant to the evaluation of the firm’s independence from the
client, the audit team shall include that related entity when identifying, evaluating and addressing
threats to independence.

[Paragraphs 400.28 to 400.29 are intentionally left blank]
Period During which Independence is Required
R400.30

Independence, as required by this Part, shall be maintained during both:
(a)

The engagement period; and

(b)

The period covered by the financial statements.

400.30 A1

The engagement period starts when the engagement team begins to perform the audit. The
engagement period ends when the audit report is issued. When the engagement is of a recurring
nature, it ends at the later of the notification by either party that the professional relationship has
ended or the issuance of the final audit report.

R400.31

If an entity becomes an audit client during or after the period covered by the financial statements
on which the firm will express an opinion, the firm shall determine whether any threats to
independence are created by:
(a)

Financial or business relationships with the audit client during or after the period covered
by the financial statements but before accepting the audit engagement; or

(b)

Previous services provided to the audit client by the firm or a network firm.

SECTION 400 Page 106 of 226

THE CODE

400.31 A1

Threats to independence are created if a non-assurance service was provided to an audit client
during, or after the period covered by the financial statements, but before the engagement team
begins to perform the audit, and the service would not be permitted during the engagement
period.

400.31 A2

A factor to be considered in such circumstances is whether the results of the service provided
might form part of or affect the accounting records, the internal controls over financial reporting,
or the financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion.

400.31 A3

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address threats independence include:

400.31 A4

•

Not assigning professionals who performed the non-assurance service to be members of
the engagement team.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer review the audit work or non-assurance service as
appropriate.

•

Engaging another firm outside of the network to evaluate the results of the non-assurance
service or having another firm outside of the network re-perform the non-assurance service
to the extent necessary to enable the other firm to take responsibility for the service.

A threat to independence created by the provision of a non-assurance service by a firm or a
network firm prior to the audit engagement period or prior to the period covered by the financial
statements on which the firm will express an opinion is eliminated or reduced to an acceptable
level if the results of such service have been used or implemented in a period audited by another
firm.

Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
R400.32

400.32 A1

A firm shall not accept appointment as auditor of a public interest entity to which the firm or the
network firm has provided a non-assurance service prior to such appointment that might create
a self-review threat in relation to the financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion
unless:
(a)

The provision of such service ceases before the commencement of the audit engagement
period;

(b)

The firm takes action to address any threats to its independence; and

(c)

The firm determines that, in the view of a reasonable and informed third party, any threats
to the firm’s independence have been or will be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable
level.

Actions that might be regarded by a reasonable and informed third party as eliminating or
reducing to an acceptable level any threats to independence created by the provision of nonassurance services to a public interest entity prior to appointment as auditor of that entity include:
•

The results of the service had been subject to auditing procedures in the course of the
audit of the prior year’s financial statements by a predecessor firm.

•

The firm engages a professional accountant, who is not a member of the firm expressing
the opinion on the financial statements, to perform a review of the first audit engagement
affected by the self-review threat consistent with the objective of an engagement quality
review.

•

The public interest entity engages another firm outside of the network to:
(i)

Evaluate the results of the non-assurance service; or

(ii)

Re-perform the service,

to the extent necessary to enable the other firm to take responsibility for the result of the service.
[Paragraphs 400.33 to 400.39 are intentionally left blank]
Communication with Those Charged with Governance
400.40 A1

Paragraphs R300.9 and R300.10 set out requirements with respect to communicating with those
charged with governance.

400.40 A2

Even when not required by the Code, applicable professional standards, laws or regulations,
regular communication is encouraged between a firm and those charged with governance of the
SECTION 400 Page 107 of 226

THE CODE

client regarding relationships and other matters that might, in the firm’s opinion, reasonably bear
on independence. Such communication enables those charged with governance to:
(a)

Consider the firm’s judgements in identifying and evaluating threats;

(b)

Consider how threats have been addressed including the appropriateness of safeguards
when they are available and capable of being applied; and

(c)

Take appropriate action.

Such an approach can be particularly helpful with respect to intimidation and familiarity threats.
[Paragraphs 400.41 to 400.49 are intentionally left blank]
Network Firms
400.50 A1

Firms frequently form larger structures with other firms and entities to enhance their ability to
provide professional services. Whether these larger structures create a network depends on the
particular facts and circumstances. It does not depend on whether the firms and entities are
legally separate and distinct.

R400.51

A network firm shall be independent of the audit clients of the other firms within the network as
required by this Part.

400.51 A1

The independence requirements in this Part that apply to a network firm apply to any entity that
meets the definition of a network firm. It is not necessary for the entity also to meet the definition
of a firm. For example, a consulting practice or professional law practice might be a network firm
but not a firm.

R400.52

When associated with a larger structure of other firms and entities, a firm shall:

R400.53

(a)

Exercise professional judgement to determine whether a network is created by such a
larger structure;

(b)

Consider whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that
the other firms and entities in the larger structure are associated in such a way that a
network exists; and

(c)

Apply such judgement consistently throughout such a larger structure.

When determining whether a network is created by a larger structure of firms and other entities,
a firm shall conclude that a network exists when such a larger structure is aimed at co-operation
and:
(a)

It is clearly aimed at profit or cost sharing among the entities within the structure. (Ref:
Para. 400.53 A2);

(b)

The entities within the structure share common ownership, control or management. (Ref:
Para. 400.53 A3);

(c)

The entities within the structure share common quality management policies and
procedures. (Ref: Para. 400.53 A4);

(d)

The entities within the structure share a common business strategy. (Ref: Para. 400.53
A5);

(e)

The entities within the structure share the use of a common brand name. (Ref: Para.
400.53 A6, 400.53 A7); or

(f)

The entities within the structure share a significant part of professional resources. (Ref:
Para 400.53 A8, 400.53 A9).

400.53 A1

There might be other arrangements between firms and entities within a larger structure that
constitute a network, in addition to those arrangements described in paragraph R400.53.
However, a larger structure might be aimed only at facilitating the referral of work, which in itself
does not meet the criteria necessary to constitute a network.

400.53 A2

The sharing of immaterial costs does not in itself create a network. In addition, if the sharing of
costs is limited only to those costs related to the development of audit methodologies, manuals
or training courses, this would not in itself create a network. Further, an association between a
firm and an otherwise unrelated entity jointly to provide a service or develop a product does not
in itself create a network. (Ref: Para. R400.53(a)).
SECTION 400 Page 108 of 226

THE CODE

400.53 A3

Common ownership, control or management might be achieved by contract or other means. (Ref:
Para. R400.53(b)).

400.53 A4

Common quality management policies and procedures are those designed, implemented and
operated across the larger structure. (Ref: Para. R400.53(c)).

400.53 A5

Sharing a common business strategy involves an agreement by the entities to achieve common
strategic objectives. An entity is not a network firm merely because it co-operates with another
entity solely to respond jointly to a request for a proposal for the provision of a professional
service. (Ref: Para. R400.53(d)).

400.53 A6

A common brand name includes common initials or a common name. A firm is using a common
brand name if it includes, for example, the common brand name as part of, or along with, its firm
name when a partner of the firm signs an audit report. (Ref: Para. R400.53(e)).

400.53 A7

Even if a firm does not belong to a network and does not use a common brand name as part of
its firm name, it might appear to belong to a network if its stationery or promotional materials refer
to the firm being a member of an association of firms. Accordingly, if care is not taken in how a
firm describes such membership, a perception might be created that the firm belongs to a
network. (Ref: Para. R400.53(e)).

400.53 A8

Professional resources include:

400.53 A9

•

Common systems that enable firms to exchange information such as client data, billing
and time records.

•

Partners and other personnel.

•

Technical departments that consult on technical or industry-specific issues, transactions
or events for assurance engagements.

•

Audit methodology or audit manuals.

•

Training courses and facilities. (Ref: Para. R400.53(f)).

Whether the shared professional resources are significant depends on the circumstances. For
example:
•

The shared resources might be limited to common audit methodology or audit manuals,
with no exchange of personnel or client or market information. In such circumstances, it is
unlikely that the shared resources would be significant. The same applies to a common
training endeavour.

•

The shared resources might involve the exchange of personnel or information, such as
where personnel are drawn from a shared pool, or where a common technical department
is created within the larger structure to provide participating firms with technical advice that
the firms are required to follow. In such circumstances, a reasonable and informed third
party is more likely to conclude that the shared resources are significant. (Ref: Para.
R400.53(f)).

R400.54

If a firm or a network sells a component of its practice, and the component continues to use all
or part of the firm’s or network’s name for a limited time, the relevant entities shall determine how
to disclose that they are not network firms when presenting themselves to outside parties.

400.54 A1

The agreement for the sale of a component of a practice might provide that, for a limited period
of time, the sold component can continue to use all or part of the name of the firm or the network,
even though it is no longer connected to the firm or the network. In such circumstances, while
the two entities might be practicing under a common name, the facts are such that they do not
belong to a larger structure aimed at cooperation. The two entities are therefore not network
firms.

[Paragraphs 400.55 to 400.59 are intentionally left blank]
General Documentation of Independence for Audit and Review Engagements
R400.60

A firm shall document conclusions regarding compliance with this Part, and the substance of any
relevant discussions that support those conclusions. In particular:
(a)

When safeguards are applied to address a threat, the firm shall document the nature of
the threat and the safeguards in place or applied; and

SECTION 400 Page 109 of 226

THE CODE

(b)

400.60 A1

When a threat required significant analysis and the firm concluded that the threat was
already at an acceptable level, the firm shall document the nature of the threat and the
rationale for the conclusion.

Documentation provides evidence of the firm’s judgements in forming conclusions regarding
compliance with this Part. However, a lack of documentation does not determine whether a firm
considered a particular matter or whether the firm is independent.

[Paragraphs 400.61 to 400.69 are intentionally left blank]
Mergers and Acquisitions
When a Client Merger Creates a Threat
400.70 A1

An entity might become a related entity of an audit client because of a merger or acquisition. A
threat to independence and, therefore, to the ability of a firm to continue an audit engagement
might be created by previous or current interests or relationships between a firm or network firm
and such a related entity.

R400.71

In the circumstances set out in paragraph 400.70 A1,

R400.72

(a)

The firm shall identify and evaluate previous and current interests and relationships with
the related entity that, taking into account any actions taken to address the threat, might
affect its independence and therefore its ability to continue the audit engagement after the
effective date of the merger or acquisition; and

(b)

Subject to paragraph R400.72, the firm shall take steps to end any interests or relationships
that are not permitted by the Code by the effective date of the merger or acquisition.

As an exception to paragraph R400.71(b), if the interest or relationship cannot reasonably be
ended by the effective date of the merger or acquisition, the firm shall:
(a)

Evaluate the threat that is created by the interest or relationship; and

(b)

Discuss with those charged with governance the reasons why the interest or relationship
cannot reasonably be ended by the effective date and the evaluation of the level of the
threat.

400.72 A1

In some circumstances, it might not be reasonably possible to end an interest or relationship
creating a threat by the effective date of the merger or acquisition. This might be because the
firm provides a non-assurance service to the related entity, which the entity is not able to
transition in an orderly manner to another provider by that date.

400.72 A2

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of a threat created by mergers and acquisitions
when there are interests and relationships that cannot reasonably be ended include:

R400.73

400.73 A1

•

The nature and significance of the interest or relationship.

•

The nature and significance of the related entity relationship (for example, whether the
related entity is a subsidiary or parent).

•

The length of time until the interest or relationship can reasonably be ended.

If, following the discussion set out in paragraph R400.72(b), those charged with governance
request the firm to continue as the auditor, the firm shall do so only if:
(a)

The interest or relationship will be ended as soon as reasonably possible but no later than
six months after the effective date of the merger or acquisition;

(b)

Any individual who has such an interest or relationship, including one that has arisen
through performing a non-assurance service that would not be permitted by Section 600
and its subsections, will not be a member of the engagement team for the audit or the
individual responsible for the engagement quality review; and

(c)

Transitional measures will be applied, as necessary, and discussed with those charged
with governance.

Examples of such transitional measures include:
•

Having a professional accountant review the audit or non-assurance work as appropriate.

SECTION 400 Page 110 of 226

THE CODE

R400.74

•

Having a professional accountant, who is not a member of the firm expressing the opinion
on the financial statements, perform a review that is consistent with the objective of an
engagement quality review.

•

Engaging another firm to evaluate the results of the non-assurance service or having
another firm re-perform the non-assurance service to the extent necessary to enable the
other firm to take responsibility for the service.

The firm might have completed a significant amount of work on the audit prior to the effective
date of the merger or acquisition and might be able to complete the remaining audit procedures
within a short period of time. In such circumstances, if those charged with governance request
the firm to complete the audit while continuing with an interest or relationship identified in
paragraph 400.70 A1, the firm shall only do so if it:
(a)

Has evaluated the level of the threat and discussed the results with those charged with
governance;

(b)

Complies with the requirements of paragraph R400.73(b) to (c); and

(c)

Ceases to be the auditor no later than the date that the audit report is issued.

If Objectivity Remains Compromised
R400.75

Even if all the requirements of paragraphs R400.71 to R400.74 could be met, the firm shall
determine whether the circumstances identified in paragraph 400.70 A1 create a threat that
cannot be addressed such that objectivity would be compromised. If so, the firm shall cease to
be the auditor.

Documentation
R400.76

The firm shall document:
(a)

Any interests or relationships identified in paragraph 400.70 A1 that will not be ended by
the effective date of the merger or acquisition and the reasons why they will not be ended;

(b)

The transitional measures applied;

(c)

The results of the discussion with those charged with governance; and

(d)

The reasons why the previous and current interests and relationships do not create a threat
such that objectivity would be compromised.

[Paragraphs 400.77 to 400.79 are intentionally left blank.]
Breach of an Independence Provision for Audit and Review Engagements
When a Firm Identifies a Breach
R400.80

If a firm concludes that a breach of a requirement in this Part has occurred, the firm shall:
(a)

End, suspend or eliminate the interest or relationship that created the breach and address
the consequences of the breach;

(b)

Consider whether any legal or regulatory requirements apply to the breach and, if so:

(c)

(d)

(i)

Comply with those requirements; and

(ii)

Consider reporting the breach to a professional or regulatory body or oversight
authority if such reporting is common practice or expected in the relevant jurisdiction;

Promptly communicate the breach in accordance with its policies and procedures to:
(i)

The engagement partner;

(ii)

THE CODE

(e)

Depending on the significance of the breach, determine:
(i)

Whether to end the audit engagement; or

(ii)

Whether it is possible to take action that satisfactorily addresses the consequences
of the breach and whether such action can be taken and is appropriate in the
circumstances.

In making this determination, the firm shall exercise professional judgement and take into
account whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that the firm’s
objectivity would be compromised, and therefore, the firm would be unable to issue an audit
report.
400.80 A1

A breach of a provision of this Part might occur despite the firm having a system of quality
management designed to address independence requirements. It might be necessary to end the
audit engagement because of the breach.

400.80 A2

The significance and impact of a breach on the firm’s objectivity and ability to issue an audit
report will depend on factors such as:

400.80 A3

•

The nature and duration of the breach.

•

The number and nature of any previous breaches with respect to the current audit
engagement.

•

Whether an audit team member had knowledge of the interest or relationship that created
the breach.

•

Whether the individual who created the breach is an audit team member or another
individual for whom there are independence requirements.

•

If the breach relates to an audit team member, the role of that individual.

•

If the breach was created by providing a professional service, the impact of that service, if
any, on the accounting records or the amounts recorded in the financial statements on
which the firm will express an opinion.

•

The extent of the self-interest, advocacy, intimidation or other threats created by the
breach.

Depending upon the significance of the breach, examples of actions that the firm might consider
to address the breach satisfactorily include:
•

Removing the relevant individual from the audit team.

•

Using different individuals to conduct an additional review of the affected audit work or to
re-perform that work to the extent necessary.

•

Recommending that the audit client engage another firm to review or re-perform the
affected audit work to the extent necessary.

•

If the breach relates to a non-assurance service that affects the accounting records or an
amount recorded in the financial statements, engaging another firm to evaluate the results
of the non-assurance service or having another firm re-perform the non-assurance service
to the extent necessary to enable the other firm to take responsibility for the service.

R400.81

If the firm determines that action cannot be taken to address the consequences of the breach
satisfactorily, the firm shall inform those charged with governance as soon as possible and take
the steps necessary to end the audit engagement in compliance with any applicable legal or
regulatory requirements. Where ending the engagement is not permitted by laws or regulations,
the firm shall comply with any reporting or disclosure requirements.

R400.82

If the firm determines that action can be taken to address the consequences of the breach
satisfactorily, the firm shall discuss with those charged with governance:
(a)

The significance of the breach, including its nature and duration;

(b)

How the breach occurred and how it was identified;

(c)

The action proposed or taken and why the action will satisfactorily address the
consequences of the breach and enable the firm to issue an audit report;

SECTION 400 Page 112 of 226

THE CODE

(d)

The conclusion that, in the firm’s professional judgement, objectivity has not been
compromised and the rationale for that conclusion; and

(e)

Any steps proposed or taken by the firm to reduce or avoid the risk of further breaches
occurring.

Such discussion shall take place as soon as possible unless an alternative timing is specified by
those charged with governance for reporting less significant breaches.
Communication of Breaches to Those Charged with Governance
400.83 A1

Paragraphs R300.9 and R300.10 set out requirements with respect to communicating with those
charged with governance.

R400.84

With respect to breaches, the firm shall communicate in writing to those charged with
governance:

R400.85

(a)

All matters discussed in accordance with paragraph R400.82 and obtain the concurrence
of those charged with governance that action can be, or has been, taken to satisfactorily
address the consequences of the breach; and

(b)

A description of:
(i)

The firm’s policies and procedures relevant to the breach designed to provide it with
reasonable assurance that independence is maintained; and

(ii)

Any steps that the firm has taken, or proposes to take, to reduce or avoid the risk of
further breaches occurring.

If those charged with governance do not concur that the action proposed by the firm in
accordance with paragraph R400.80(e)(ii) satisfactorily addresses the consequences of the
breach, the firm shall take the steps necessary to end the audit engagement in accordance with
paragraph R400.81.

Breaches Before the Previous Audit Report Was Issued
R400.86

If the breach occurred prior to the issuance of the previous audit report, the firm shall comply
with the provisions of Part 4A in evaluating the significance of the breach and its impact on the
firm’s objectivity and its ability to issue an audit report in the current period.

R400.87

The firm shall also:
(a)

Consider the impact of the breach, if any, on the firm’s objectivity in relation to any
previously issued audit reports, and the possibility of withdrawing such audit reports; and

(b)

Discuss the matter with those charged with governance.

Documentation
R400.88

SECTION 405
GROUP AUDITS
Introduction
405.1

Section 400 requires a firm to be independent when performing an audit engagement, and to
apply the conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats
to independence. This section sets out specific requirements and application material relevant to
applying the conceptual framework when performing a group audit engagement.

Requirements and Application Material
General
405.2 A1

ISAs apply to an audit of group financial statements. ISA 600 (Revised) deals with special
considerations that apply to an audit of group financial statements, including when component
auditors are involved. ISA 600 (Revised) requires the group engagement partner to take
responsibility for confirming whether the component auditors understand and will comply with the
relevant ethical requirements, including those related to independence, that apply to the group
audit. The independence requirements referred to in ISA 600 (Revised), or other relevant auditing
standards applicable to group audits that are equivalent to ISA 600 (Revised), are those specified
in this section.

405.2 A2

A component auditor firm that participates in a group audit engagement might separately issue
an audit opinion on the financial statements of the component audit client. Depending on the
circumstances, the component auditor firm might need to comply with different independence
requirements when performing audit work for a group audit and separately issuing an audit
opinion on the financial statements of the component audit client for statutory, regulatory or other
reasons.

Communication Between a Group Auditor Firm and a Component Auditor Firm
R405.3

ISA 600 (Revised) requires the group engagement partner to take responsibility to make a
component auditor aware of the relevant ethical requirements that are applicable given the nature
and the circumstances of the group audit engagement. When making the component auditor firm
aware of the relevant ethical requirements, the group auditor firm shall communicate at
appropriate times the necessary information to enable the component auditor firm to meet its
responsibilities under this section.

405.3 A1

Examples of matters the group auditor firm might communicate include:

R405.4

405.4 A1

•

Whether the group audit client is a public interest entity and the relevant ethical
requirements applicable to the group audit engagement.

•

The related entities and other components within the group audit client that are relevant
to the independence considerations applicable to the component auditor firm and the
group audit team members within, or engaged by, that firm.

•

The period during which the component auditor firm is required to be independent.

•

Whether an audit partner who performs work at the component for purposes of the group
audit is a key audit partner for the group audit.

ISA 600 (Revised) also requires the group engagement partner to request the component auditor
to communicate whether the component auditor has complied with the relevant ethical
requirements, including those related to independence, that apply to the group audit engagement.
For the purposes of this section, such a request shall include the communication of:
(a)

Any independence matters that require significant judgement; and

(b)

In relation to those matters, the component auditor firm’s conclusion whether the threats
to its independence are at an acceptable level, and the rationale for that conclusion.

If a matter comes to the attention of the group engagement partner that indicates that a threat to
independence exists, ISA 220 (Revised) requires the group engagement partner to evaluate the
threat and take appropriate action.

Independence Considerations Applicable to Individuals
Members of the Group Audit Team Within, or Engaged by, a Group Auditor Firm and Its Network Firms
R405.5

Members of the group audit team within, or engaged by, the group auditor firm and its network
firms shall be independent of the group audit client in accordance with the requirements of this
Part that are applicable to the audit team.

Other Members of the Group Audit Team
R405.6

Members of the group audit team within, or engaged by, a component auditor firm outside the
group auditor firm’s network shall be independent of:
(a)

The component audit client;

(b)

The entity on whose group financial statements the group auditor firm expresses an
opinion; and

(c)

Any entity over which the entity in subparagraph (b) has direct or indirect control,
provided that such entity has direct or indirect control over the component audit client,

in accordance with the requirements of this Part that are applicable to the audit team.
R405.7

In relation to related entities or components within the group audit client other than those covered
in paragraph R405.6, a member of the group audit team within, or engaged by, a component
auditor firm outside the group auditor firm’s network shall notify the component auditor firm about
any relationship or circumstance the individual knows, or has reason to believe, might create a
threat to the individual’s independence in the context of the group audit.

405.7 A1

Examples of relationships or circumstances involving the individual or any of the individual’s
immediate family members, as applicable, that are relevant to the individual’s consideration when
complying with paragraph R405.7 include:
•

A direct or material indirect financial interest in an entity that has control over the group
audit client if the group audit client is material to that entity (see Section 510).

•

A loan or guarantee involving: (see Section 511)
An entity that is not a bank or similar institution unless the loan or guarantee is
immaterial; or

o

A bank or similar institution unless the loan or guarantee is made under normal
lending procedures, terms and conditions.

•

A business relationship that is significant or involves a material financial interest (see
Section 520).

•

An immediate family member who is: (see Section 521)

o

A director or officer of an entity; or

o

An employee in a position to exert significant influence over the preparation of an
entity’s accounting records or financial statements.

Upon receiving the notification as set out in paragraph R405.7, the component auditor firm shall
evaluate and address any threats to independence created by the individual’s relationship or
circumstance.

Independence Considerations Applicable to a Group Auditor Firm
R405.9

A group auditor firm shall be independent of the group audit client in accordance with the
requirements of this Part that are applicable to a firm.

SECION 405 Page 115 of 226

THE CODE

Independence Considerations Applicable to Network Firms of a Group Auditor Firm
R405.10

A network firm of the group auditor firm shall be independent of the group audit client in
accordance with the requirements of this Part that are applicable to a network firm.

Independence Considerations Applicable to Component Auditor Firms outside a Group Auditor
Firm’s Network
All Group Audit Clients
R405.11

A component auditor firm outside the group auditor firm’s network shall:
(a)

Be independent of the component audit client in accordance with the requirements set out
in this Part that are applicable to a firm with respect to all audit clients;

(b)

Apply the relevant requirements in paragraphs R510.4(a), R510.7 and R510.9 with respect
to financial interests in the entity on whose group financial statements the group auditor
firm expresses an opinion; and

(c)

Apply the relevant requirements in Section 511 with respect to loans and guarantees
involving the entity on whose group financial statements the group auditor firm expresses
an opinion.

R405.12

When a component auditor firm outside the group auditor firm’s network knows, or has reason
to believe, that a relationship or circumstance involving the group audit client, beyond those
addressed in paragraph R405.11(b) and (c), is relevant to the evaluation of the component
auditor firm’s independence from the component audit client, the component auditor firm shall
include that relationship or circumstance when identifying, evaluating and addressing threats to
independence.

R405.13

When a component auditor firm outside the group auditor firm’s network knows, or has reason
to believe, that a relationship or circumstance of a firm within the component auditor firm’s
network with the component audit client or the group audit client creates a threat to the
component auditor firm’s independence, the component auditor firm shall evaluate and address
any such threat.

Period During which Independence is Required
405.14 A1

The references to the financial statements and the audit report in paragraphs R400.30 and
400.30 A1 mean the group financial statements and the audit report on the group financial
statements, respectively, when applied in this section.

Group Audit Clients that are Not Public Interest Entities
R405.15

When the group audit client is not a public interest entity, a component auditor firm outside the
group auditor firm’s network shall be independent of the component audit client in accordance
with the requirements set out in this Part that are applicable to audit clients that are not public
interest entities for the purposes of the group audit.

405.15 A1

Where a component auditor firm outside the group auditor firm’s network also performs an audit
engagement for a component audit client that is a public interest entity for reasons other than the
group audit, for example, a statutory audit, the independence requirements that are relevant to
audit clients that are public interest entities apply to that engagement.

Group Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
Non-Assurance Services
R405.16

Subject to paragraph R405.17, when the group audit client is a public interest entity, a component
auditor firm outside the group auditor firm’s network shall comply with the provisions in Section
600 that are applicable to public interest entities with respect to the provision of non-assurance
services to the component audit client.

405.16 A1

Where the group audit client is a public interest entity, a component auditor firm outside the group
auditor firm’s network is prohibited from, for example:
•

Providing accounting and bookkeeping services to a component audit client that is not a
public interest entity (see Subsection 601).

SECION 405 Page 116 of 226

THE CODE

•

Designing the information technology system, or an aspect of it, for a component audit
client that is not a public interest entity where such information technology system
generates information for the component audit client’s accounting records or financial
statements (see Subsection 606).

•

Acting in an advocacy role for a component audit client that is not a public interest entity
in resolving a dispute or litigation before a tribunal or court (see Subsection 608).

405.16 A2

The financial information on which a component auditor firm outside the group auditor firm’s
network performs audit procedures is relevant to the evaluation of the self-review threat that
might be created by the component auditor firm’s provision of a non-assurance service, and
therefore the application of Section 600. For example, if the component auditor firm’s audit
procedures are limited to a specific item such as inventory, the results of any non-assurance
service that form part of or affect the accounting records or the financial information related to
the accounting for, or the internal controls over, inventory are relevant to the evaluation of the
self-review threat.

R405.17

As an exception to paragraph R405.16, a component auditor firm outside the group auditor firm’s
network may provide a non-assurance service that is not prohibited under Section 600 to a
component audit client without communicating information about the proposed non-assurance
service to those charged with governance of the group audit client or obtaining their concurrence
regarding the provision of that service as addressed by paragraphs R600.22 to R600.25.

Key Audit Partners
R405.18

405.18 A1

The group engagement partner shall determine whether an audit partner who performs audit work
at a component for purposes of the group audit is a key audit partner for the group audit. If so,
the group engagement partner shall:
(a)

Communicate that determination to that individual; and

(b)

Indicate:

(i)

In the case of all group audit clients, that the individual is subject to paragraph
R411.4, and

(ii)

In the case of group audit clients that are public interest entities, that the individual
is also subject to paragraphs R524.6, R540.5(c) and R540.21.

A key audit partner makes key decisions or judgements on significant matters with respect to the
audit of the group financial statements on which the group auditor firm expresses an opinion in
the group audit.

Changes in Components
All Group Audit Clients
R405.19

When an entity that is not a related entity becomes a component within the group audit client,
the group auditor firm shall apply paragraphs R400.71 to R400.76.

Changes in Component Auditor Firms
All Group Audit Clients
405.20 A1

405.20 A2

There might be circumstances in which the group auditor firm requests another firm to perform
audit work as a component auditor firm during or after the period covered by the group financial
statements, for example due to a client merger or acquisition. A threat to the component auditor
firm’s independence might be created by:
(a)

Financial or business relationships of the component auditor firm with the component audit
client during or after the period covered by the group financial statements but before the
component auditor firm agrees to perform the audit work; or

(b)

Previous services provided to the component audit client by the component auditor firm.

Paragraphs 400.31 A1 to A3 set out application material that is applicable for a component
auditor firm’s assessment of threats to independence if a non-assurance service was provided
by the component auditor firm to the component audit client during or after the period covered
by the group financial statements, but before the component auditor firm begins to perform the
SECION 405 Page 117 of 226

THE CODE

audit work for the purposes of the group audit, and the service would not be permitted during the
engagement period.
405.20 A3

Paragraph 400.31 A4 sets out application material that is applicable for a component auditor
firm’s assessment of threats to independence if a non-assurance service was provided by the
component auditor firm to the component audit client prior to the period covered by the group
financial statements.

Group Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
405.21 A1

Paragraphs R400.32 and 400.32 A1 are applicable when a component auditor firm agrees to
perform audit work for group audit purposes in relation to a group audit client that is a public
interest entity if the component auditor firm has previously provided a non-assurance service to
the component audit client.

405.21 A2

Paragraphs R600.26 and 600.26 A1 are applicable in relation to a non-assurance service
provided, either currently or previously, by a component auditor firm to a component audit client
when the group audit client subsequently becomes a public interest entity.

Breach of an Independence Provision at a Component Auditor Firm
405.22 A1

A breach of a provision of this section might occur despite a component auditor firm having a
system of quality management designed to address independence requirements. Paragraphs
R405.23 to R405.29 are relevant to a group auditor firm’s determination as to whether it would
be able to use a component auditor firm’s work if a breach has occurred at the component auditor
firm.

405.22 A2

In the case of a breach at a component auditor firm within the group auditor firm’s network,
paragraphs R400.80 to R400.89 also apply to the group auditor firm in relation to the group audit,
as applicable.

When a Component Auditor Firm Identifies a Breach
R405.23

405.23 A1

R405.24

If a component auditor firm concludes that a breach of this section has occurred, the component
auditor firm shall:
(a)

End, suspend or eliminate the interest or relationship that created the breach and address
the consequences of the breach;

(b)

Evaluate the significance of the breach and its impact on the component auditor firm’s
objectivity and ability to perform audit work for the purposes of the group audit;

(c)

Depending on the significance of the breach, determine whether it is possible to take action
that satisfactorily addresses the consequences of the breach and whether such action can
be taken and is appropriate in the circumstances; and

(d)

Promptly communicate in writing the breach to the group engagement partner, including
the component auditor firm’s assessment of the significance of the breach and any actions
proposed or taken to address the consequences of the breach.

Paragraphs 400.80 A2 and A3 set out application material relevant to the component auditor
firm’s evaluation of the significance and impact of the breach on the component auditor firm's
objectivity and ability to issue an opinion or conclusion on the audit work performed at the
component for purposes of the group audit, and its consideration of any actions that might be
taken to address the consequences of the breach satisfactorily.
Upon receipt of the component auditor firm’s communication of the breach, the group
engagement partner shall:
(a)

Review the component auditor firm’s assessment of the significance of the breach and its
impact on the component auditor firm’s objectivity, and any action that can be or has been
taken to address the consequences of the breach;

(b)

Evaluate the group auditor firm’s ability to use the work of the component auditor firm for
the purposes of the group audit; and

(c)

Determine the need for any further action.

SECION 405 Page 118 of 226

THE CODE

R405.25

In applying paragraph R405.24, the group engagement partner shall exercise professional
judgement and take into account whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely
to conclude that the component auditor firm’s objectivity is compromised, and therefore, the
group auditor firm is unable to use the work of the component auditor firm for the purposes of the
group audit.

405.25 A1

If the group engagement partner determines that the consequences of the breach have been
satisfactorily addressed by the component auditor firm and do not compromise the component
auditor firm’s objectivity, the group auditor firm may continue to use the work of the component
auditor firm for the group audit. In certain circumstances, the group engagement partner might
determine that additional actions are needed to satisfactorily address the breach in order to use
the component auditor firm’s work. Examples of such action include the group auditor firm
performing specific procedures on the areas impacted by the breach or requesting the
component auditor firm to perform appropriate remedial work on the affected areas.

405.25 A2

ISA 600 (Revised) sets out that if there has been a breach by a component auditor and the
breach has not been satisfactorily addressed, the group auditor cannot use the work of that
component auditor. In those circumstances, the group engagement partner might find other
means to obtain the necessary audit evidence on the component audit client’s financial
information. Examples of such means include the group auditor firm performing the necessary
audit work on the component audit client’s financial information or requesting another component
auditor firm to perform such audit work.

Discussion with Those Charged with Governance of the Group Audit Client
405.26 A1

With respect to breaches by a component auditor firm within the group auditor firm’s network,
paragraph R400.84 applies.

R405.27

With respect to breaches by a component auditor firm outside the group auditor firm’s network,
the group auditor firm shall discuss with those charged with governance of the group audit client:
(a)

The component auditor firm’s assessment of the significance and impact of the breach on
the component auditor firm’s objectivity, including the nature and duration of the breach,
and the action that can be or has been taken; and

(b)

Whether:
(i)

The action will satisfactorily address, or has addressed, the consequences of the
breach; or

(ii)

The group auditor firm will use other means to obtain the necessary audit evidence
on the component audit client’s financial information.

Such discussion shall take place as soon as possible unless an alternative timing is specified by
those charged with governance for reporting less significant breaches.
R405.28

The group auditor firm shall communicate in writing to those charged with governance of the
group audit client all matters discussed in accordance with paragraph R405.27 and obtain the
concurrence of those charged with governance that the action can be or has been taken to
satisfactorily address the consequences of the breach.

R405.29

If those charged with governance do not concur that the action that can be or has been taken
would satisfactorily address the consequences of the breach at the component auditor firm, the
group auditor firm shall not use the work performed by the component auditor firm for the
purposes of the group audit.

SECTION 410
FEES
Introduction
410.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

410.2

Section 330 sets out application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework where
the level and nature of fee and other remuneration arrangements might create a self-interest
threat to compliance with one or more of the fundamental principles. This section sets out specific
requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework to identify,
evaluate and address threats to independence arising from fees charged to audit clients.

Requirements and Application Material
General
410.3 A1

Fees for professional services are usually negotiated with and paid by an audit client and might
create threats to independence. This practice is generally recognised and accepted by intended
users of financial statements.

410.3 A2

When the audit client is a public interest entity, stakeholders have heightened expectations
regarding the firm’s independence. As transparency can serve to better inform the views and
decisions of those charged with governance and a wide range of stakeholders, this section
provides for disclosure of fee-related information to both those charged with governance and
stakeholders more generally for audit clients that are public interest entities.

410.3 A3

For the purposes of this section, audit fees comprise fees or other types of remuneration for an
audit or review of financial statements. Where reference is made to the fee for the audit of the
financial statements, this does not include any fee for an audit of special purpose financial
statements or a review of financial statements. (Ref: Para. R410.23(a), 410.25 A1 and
R410.31(a))

Fees Paid by an Audit Client
410.4 A1

When fees are negotiated with and paid by an audit client, this creates a self-interest threat and
might create an intimidation threat to independence.

410.4 A2

The application of the conceptual framework requires that before a firm or network firm accepts
an audit or any other engagement for an audit client, the firm determines whether the threats to
independence created by the fees proposed to the client are at an acceptable level. The
application of the conceptual framework also requires the firm to re-evaluate such threats when
facts and circumstances change during the engagement period for the audit.

410.4 A3

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats created when fees for an audit or any
other engagement are paid by the audit client include:
•

The level of the fees and the extent to which they have regard to the resources required,
taking into account the firm’s commercial and market priorities.

•

Any linkage between fees for the audit and those for services other than audit and the
relative size of both elements.

•

The extent of any dependency between the level of the fee for, and the outcome of, the
service.

•

Whether the fee is for services to be provided by the firm or a network firm.

•

The level of the fee in the context of the service to be provided by the firm or a network
firm.

•

The operating structure and the compensation arrangements of the firm and network firms.

•

The significance of the client, or a third party referring the client, to the firm, network firm,
partner or office.

•

The nature of the client, for example whether the client is a public interest entity.

SECTION 410 Page 120 of 226

THE CODE

•

The relationship of the client to the related entities to which the services other than audit
are provided, for example when the related entity is a sister entity.

•

The involvement of those charged with governance in appointing the auditor and agreeing
fees, and the apparent emphasis they and client management place on the quality of the
audit and the overall level of the fees.

•

Whether the level of the fee is set by an independent third party, such as a regulatory body.

•

Whether the quality of the firm’s audit work is subject to the review of an independent third
party, such as an oversight body.

410.4 A4

The conditions, policies and procedures described in paragraph 120.15 A3 (particularly a system
of quality management designed, implemented and operated by the firm in accordance with
quality management standards issued by the IAASB) might also impact the evaluation of whether
the threats to independence are at an acceptable level.

410.4 A5

The requirements and application material that follow identify circumstances which might need
to be further evaluated when determining whether the threats are at an acceptable level. For
those circumstances, application material includes examples of additional factors that might be
relevant in evaluating the threats.

Level of Audit Fees
410.5 A1

Determining the fees to be charged to an audit client, whether for audit or other services, is a
business decision of the firm taking into account the facts and circumstances relevant to that
specific engagement, including the requirements of technical and professional standards.

410.5 A2

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of self-interest and intimidation threats created
by the level of the audit fee paid by the audit client include:

410.5 A3

•

The firm’s commercial rationale for the audit fee.

•

Whether undue pressure has been, or is being, applied by the client to reduce the audit
fee.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:
•

Having an appropriate reviewer who does not take part in the audit engagement assess
the reasonableness of the fee proposed, having regard to the scope and complexity of the
engagement.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who did not take part in the audit engagement review the
work performed.

Impact of Other Services Provided to an Audit Client
R410.6

Subject to paragraph R410.7, a firm shall not allow the audit fee to be influenced by the provision
of services other than audit to an audit client by the firm or a network firm.

410.6 A1

The audit fee ordinarily reflects a combination of matters, such as those identified in paragraph
410.23 A1. However, the provision of other services to an audit client is not an appropriate
consideration in determining the audit fee.

R410.7

As an exception to paragraph R410.6, when determining the audit fee, the firm may take into
consideration the cost savings achieved as a result of experience derived from the provision of
services other than audit to an audit client.

Contingent Fees
410.8 A1

Contingent fees are fees calculated on a predetermined basis relating to the outcome of a
transaction or the result of the services performed. A contingent fee charged through an
intermediary is an example of an indirect contingent fee. In this section, a fee is not regarded as
being contingent if established by a court or other public authority.

R410.9

A firm shall not charge directly or indirectly a contingent fee for an audit engagement.

R410.10

A firm or network firm shall not charge directly or indirectly a contingent fee for a non-assurance
service provided to an audit client, if:
(a)

The fee is charged by the firm expressing the opinion on the financial statements and the
fee is material or expected to be material to that firm;

SECTION 410 Page 121 of 226

THE CODE

(b)

The fee is charged by a network firm that participates in a significant part of the audit and
the fee is material or expected to be material to that firm; or

(c)

The outcome of the non-assurance service, and therefore the amount of the fee, is
dependent on a future or contemporary judgement related to the audit of a material amount
in the financial statements.

410.10 A1

Paragraphs R410.9 and R410.10 preclude a firm or a network firm from entering into certain
contingent fee arrangements with an audit client. Even if a contingent fee arrangement is not
precluded when providing a non-assurance service to an audit client, it might still impact the level
of the self-interest threat.

410.10 A2

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:

410.10 A3

•

The range of possible fee amounts.

•

Whether an appropriate authority determines the outcome on which the contingent fee
depends.

•

Disclosure to intended users of the work performed by the firm and the basis of
remuneration.

•

The nature of the service.

•

The effect of the event or transaction on the financial statements.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:
•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in performing the non-assurance
service review the work performed.

•

Obtaining an advance written agreement with the client on the basis of remuneration.

Total Fees – Proportion of Fees for Services Other than Audit to Audit Fee
410.11 A1

The level of the self-interest threat might be impacted when a large proportion of fees charged
by the firm or network firms to an audit client is generated by providing services other than audit
to the client, due to concerns about the potential loss of either the audit engagement or other
services. Such circumstances might also create an intimidation threat. A further consideration is
a perception that the firm or network firm focuses on the non-audit relationship, which might
create a threat to the auditor’s independence.

410.11 A2

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such threats include:

410.11 A3

•

The ratio of fees for services other than audit to the audit fee.

•

The length of time during which a large proportion of fees for services other than audit to
the audit fee has existed.

•

The nature, scope and purposes of the services other than audit, including:
o

Whether they are recurring services.

o

Whether law or regulation mandates the services to be performed by the firm.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such self-interest or intimidation threats
include:
•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in the audit or the service other than
audit review the relevant audit work.

•

Reducing the extent of services other than audit provided to the audit client.

Total Fees – Overdue Fees
410.12 A1

The level of the self-interest threat might be impacted if fees payable by an audit client for the
audit or services other than audit are overdue during the period of the audit engagement.

410.12 A2

It is generally expected that the firm will obtain payment of such fees before the audit report is
issued.

410.12 A3

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a self-interest threat include:
•

The significance of the overdue fees to the firm.

SECTION 410 Page 122 of 226

THE CODE

410.12 A4

R410.13

•

The length of time the fees have been overdue.

•

The firm’s assessment of the ability and willingness of the audit client to pay the overdue
fees.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a threat include:
•

Obtaining partial payment of overdue fees.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who did not take part in the audit engagement review the
audit work.

When a significant part of the fees due from an audit client remains unpaid for a long time, the
firm shall determine:
(a)

Whether the overdue fees might be equivalent to a loan to the client, in which case the
requirements and application material set out in section 511 are applicable; and

(b)

Whether it is appropriate for the firm to be re-appointed or continue the audit engagement.

Total Fees – Fee Dependency
All Audit Clients
410.14 A1

When the total fees generated from an audit client by the firm expressing the audit opinion
represent a large proportion of the total fees of that firm, the dependence on, and concern about
the potential loss of, fees from audit and other services from that client impact the level of the
self-interest threat and create an intimidation threat.

410.14 A2

In calculating the total fees of the firm, the firm might use financial information available from the
previous financial year and estimate the proportion based on that information if appropriate.

410.14 A3

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such self-interest and intimidation threats
include:

410.14 A4

•

The operating structure of the firm.

•

Whether the firm is expected to diversify such that any dependence on the audit client is
reduced.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:
•

Having an appropriate reviewer who is not a member of the firm review the audit work.

•

Reducing the extent of services other than audit provided to the audit client.

•

Increasing the client base of the firm to reduce dependence on the client.

•

Increasing the extent of services provided to other clients.

410.14 A5

A self-interest or intimidation threat is created when the fees generated by a firm from an audit
client represent a large proportion of the revenue of one partner or one office of the firm.

410.14 A6

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such threats include:

410.14 A7

•

The qualitative and quantitative significance of the audit client to the partner or office.

•

The extent to which the compensation of the partner, or the partners in the office, is
dependent upon the fees generated from the client.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such self-interest or intimidation threats
include:
•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in the audit engagement review the
audit work.

•

Ensuring that the compensation of the partner is not significantly influenced by the fees
generated from the client.

•

Reducing the extent of services other than audit provided by the partner or office to the
audit client.

•

Increasing the client base of the partner or the office to reduce dependence on the client.

•

Increasing the extent of services provided by the partner or the office to other clients.

Audit Clients that are Not Public Interest Entities
R410.15

When for each of five consecutive years total fees from an audit client that is not a public interest
entity represent, or are likely to represent, more than 30% of the total fees received by the firm,
the firm shall determine whether either of the following actions might be a safeguard to reduce
the threats created to an acceptable level, and if so, apply it:
(a)

Prior to the audit opinion being issued on the fifth year’s financial statements, have a
professional accountant, who is not a member of the firm expressing the opinion on the
financial statements, review the fifth year’s audit work; or

(b)

After the audit opinion on the fifth year’s financial statements has been issued, and before
the audit opinion is issued on the sixth year’s financial statements, have a professional
accountant, who is not a member of the firm expressing the opinion on the financial
statements, or a professional body review the fifth year’s audit work.

R410.16

If the total fees described in paragraph R410.15 continue to exceed 30%, the firm shall each
year determine whether either of the actions in paragraph R410.15 applied to the relevant year’s
engagement might be a safeguard to address the threats created by the total fees received by
the firm from the client, and if so, apply it.

R410.17

When two or more firms are engaged to conduct an audit of the client’s financial statements, the
involvement of the other firm in the audit may be regarded each year as an action equivalent to
that in paragraph R410.15 (a), if:
(a)

The circumstances addressed by paragraph R410.15 apply to only one of the firms
expressing the audit opinion; and

(b)

Each firm performs sufficient work to take full individual responsibility for the audit opinion.

Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
R410.18

When for each of two consecutive years the total fees from an audit client that is a public interest
entity represent, or are likely to represent, more than 15% of the total fees received by the firm,
the firm shall determine whether, prior to the audit opinion being issued on the second year’s
financial statements, a review, consistent with the objective of an engagement quality review,
performed by a professional accountant who is not a member of the firm expressing the opinion
on the financial statements (“pre-issuance review”) might be a safeguard to reduce the threats to
an acceptable level, and if so, apply it.

R410.19

When two or more firms are engaged to conduct an audit of the client’s financial statements, the
involvement of the other firm in the audit may be regarded each year as an action equivalent to
that in paragraph R410.18, if:
(a)

The circumstances addressed by paragraph R410.18 apply to only one of the firms
expressing the audit opinion; and

(b)

Each firm performs sufficient work to take full individual responsibility for the audit opinion.

R410.20

Subject to paragraph R410.21, if the circumstances described in paragraph R410.18 continue
for five consecutive years, the firm shall cease to be the auditor after the audit opinion for the
fifth year is issued.

R410.21

As an exception to paragraph R410.20, the firm may continue to be the auditor after five
consecutive years if there is a compelling reason to do so having regard to the public interest,
provided that:

410.21 A1

(a)

The firm consults with a regulatory or professional body in the relevant jurisdiction and it
concurs that having the firm continue as the auditor would be in the public interest; and

(b)

Before the audit opinion on the sixth and any subsequent year’s financial statements is
issued, the firm engages a professional accountant, who is not a member of the firm
expressing the opinion on the financial statements, to perform a pre-issuance review.

A factor which might give rise to a compelling reason is the lack of viable alternative firms to carry
out the audit engagement, having regard to the nature and location of the client’s business.

Transparency of Information Regarding Fees for Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
Communication About Fee-related Information with Those Charged with Governance
410.22 A1

Communication by the firm of fee-related information (for both audit and services other than
audit) with those charged with governance assists in their assessment of the firm’s
independence. Effective communication in this regard also allows for a two-way open exchange
of views and information about, for example, the expectations that those charged with
governance might have regarding the scope and extent of audit work and impact on the audit
fee.

Fees for the Audit of the Financial Statements
R410.23

410.23 A1

Subject to paragraph R410.24, the firm shall communicate in a timely manner with those charged
with governance of an audit client that is a public interest entity:
(a)

Fees paid or payable to the firm or network firms for the audit of the financial statements
on which the firm expresses an opinion; and

(b)

Whether the threats created by the level of those fees are at an acceptable level, and if
not, any actions the firm has taken or proposes to take to reduce such threats to an
acceptable level.

The objective of such communication is to provide the background and context to the fees for
the audit of the financial statements on which the firm expresses an opinion to enable those
charged with governance to consider the independence of the firm. The nature and extent of
matters to be communicated will depend on the facts and circumstances and might include for
example:
•

Considerations affecting the level of the fees such as:
o

The scale, complexity and geographic spread of the audit client’s operations.

o

The time spent or expected to be spent commensurate with the scope and
complexity of the audit.

o

The cost of other resources utilised or expended in performing the audit.

o

The quality of record keeping and processes for financial statements preparation.

•

Adjustments to the fees quoted or charged during the period of the audit, and the reasons
for any such adjustments.

•

Changes to laws and regulations and professional standards relevant to the audit that
impacted the fees.

410.23 A2

The firm is encouraged to provide such information as soon as practicable and communicate
proposed adjustments as appropriate.

R410.24

As an exception to paragraph R410.23, the firm may determine not to communicate the
information set out in paragraph R410.23 to those charged with governance of an entity that is
(directly or indirectly) wholly-owned by another public interest entity provided that:
(a)

The entity is consolidated into group financial statements prepared by that other public
interest entity; and

(b)

The firm or a network firm expresses an opinion on those group financial statements.

Fees for Other Services
R410.25

Subject to paragraph R410.27, the firm shall communicate in a timely manner with those charged
with governance of an audit client that is a public interest entity:
(a)

The fees, other than those disclosed under paragraph R410.23 (a), charged to the client
for the provision of services by the firm or a network firm during the period covered by the
financial statements on which the firm expresses an opinion. For this purpose, such fees
shall only include fees charged to the client and its related entities over which the client
has direct or indirect control that are consolidated in the financial statements on which the
firm will express an opinion; and

SECTION 410 Page 125 of 226

THE CODE

(b)

410.25 A1

As set out in paragraph 410.11 A1, where the firm has identified that there is an impact on
the level of the self-interest threat or that there is an intimidation threat to independence
created by the proportion of fees for services other than audit relative to the audit fee:
(i)

Whether such threats are at an acceptable level; and

(ii)

If not, any actions that the firm has taken or proposes to take to reduce such threats
to an acceptable level.

The objective of such communication is to provide the background and context to the fees for
other services to enable those charged with governance to consider the independence of the
firm. The nature and extent of matters to be communicated will depend on the facts and
circumstances and might include for example:
•

The amount of fees for other services that are required by law or regulation.

•

The nature of other services provided and their associated fees.

•

Information on the nature of the services provided under a general policy approved by
those charged with governance and associated fees.

•

The proportion of fees referred to in paragraph R410.25(a) to the aggregate of the fees
charged by the firm and network firms for the audit of the financial statements on which
the firm expresses an opinion.

R410.26

The firm shall include in the communication required by paragraph R410.25(a) the fees, other
than those disclosed under paragraph R410.23(a), charged to any other related entities over
which the audit client has direct or indirect control for the provision of services by the firm or a
network firm, when the firm knows, or has reason to believe, that such fees are relevant to the
evaluation of the firm’s independence.

410.26 A1

Factors the firm might consider when determining whether the fees, other than those disclosed
under paragraph R410.23(a), charged to such other related entities, individually and in the
aggregate, for the provision of services by the firm or a network firm are relevant to the evaluation
of the firm’s independence include:

R410.27

•

The extent of the audit client’s involvement in the appointment of the firm or network firm
for the provision of such services, including the negotiation of fees.

•

The significance of the fees paid by the other related entities to the firm or a network firm.

•

The proportion of fees from the other related entities to the fees paid by the client.

As an exception to paragraph R410.25, the firm may determine not to communicate the
information set out in paragraph R410.25 to those charged with governance of an entity that is
(directly or indirectly) wholly-owned by another public interest entity provided that:
(a)

The entity is consolidated into group financial statements prepared by that other public
interest entity; and

(b)

The firm or a network firm expresses an opinion on those group financial statements.

Fee Dependency
R410.28

Where the total fees from an audit client that is a public interest entity represent, or are likely to
represent, more than 15% of the total fees received by the firm, the firm shall communicate with
those charged with governance:
(a)

That fact and whether this situation is likely to continue;

(b)

The safeguards applied to address the threats created, including, where relevant, the use
of a pre-issuance review (Ref: Para R410.18); and

(c)

Any proposal to continue as the auditor under paragraph R410.21.

Public Disclosure of Fee-related Information
410.29 A1

In view of the public interest in the audits of public interest entities, it is beneficial for stakeholders
to have visibility about the professional relationships between the firm and the audit client which
might reasonably be thought to be relevant to the evaluation of the firm’s independence. In a
wide number of jurisdictions, there already exist requirements regarding the disclosure of fees
by an audit client for both audit and services other than audit paid and payable to the firm and
SECTION 410 Page 126 of 226

THE CODE

network firms. Such disclosures often require the disaggregation of fees for services other than
audit into different categories.
R410.30

410.30 A1

R410.31

If laws and regulations do not require an audit client to disclose audit fees, fees for services other
than audit paid or payable to the firm and network firms and information about fee dependency,
the firm shall discuss with those charged with governance of an audit client that is a public interest
entity:
(a)

The benefit to the client’s stakeholders of the client making such disclosures that are not
required by laws and regulations in a manner deemed appropriate, taking into account the
timing and accessibility of the information; and

(b)

The information that might enhance the users’ understanding of the fees paid or payable
and their impact on the firm’s independence.

Examples of information relating to fees that might enhance the users’ understanding of the fees
paid or payable and their impact on the firm’s independence include:
•

Comparative information of the prior year’s fees for audit and services other than audit.

•

The nature of services and their associated fees as disclosed under paragraph R410.31(b).

•

Safeguards applied when the total fees from the client represent or are likely to represent
more than 15% of the total fees received by the firm.

After the discussion with those charged with governance as set out in paragraph R410.30, to the
extent that the audit client that is a public interest entity does not make the relevant disclosure,
subject to paragraph R410.32, the firm shall publicly disclose:
(a)

Fees paid or payable to the firm and network firms for the audit of the financial statements
on which the firm expresses an opinion;

(b)

Fees, other than those disclosed under (a), charged to the client for the provision of
services by the firm or a network firm during the period covered by the financial statements
on which the firm expresses an opinion. For this purpose, such fees shall only include fees
charged to the client and its related entities over which the client has direct or indirect
control that are consolidated in the financial statements on which the firm will express an
opinion;

(c)

Any fees, other than those disclosed under (a) and (b), charged to any other related entities
over which the audit client has direct or indirect control for the provision of services by the
firm or a network firm when the firm knows, or has reason to believe, that such fees are
relevant to the evaluation of the firm’s independence; and

(d)

If applicable, the fact that the total fees received by the firm from the audit client represent,
or are likely to represent, more than 15% of the total fees received by the firm for two
consecutive years, and the year that this situation first arose.

410.31 A1

The firm might also disclose other information relating to fees that will enhance the users’
understanding of the fees paid or payable and the firm’s independence, such as the examples
described in paragraph 410.30 A1.

410.31 A2

Factors the firm might consider when making the determination required by paragraph
R410.31(c) are set out in paragraph 410.26 A1.

410.31 A3

When disclosing fee-related information in compliance with paragraph R410.31, the firm might
disclose the information in a manner deemed appropriate taking into account the timing and
accessibility of the information to stakeholders, for example:

R410.32

•

On the firm’s website.

•

In the firm’s transparency report.

•

In an audit quality report.

•

Through targeted communication to specific stakeholders, for example a letter to the
shareholders.

•

In the auditor’s report.

As an exception to paragraph R410.31, the firm may determine not to publicly disclose the
information set out in paragraph R410.31 relating to:

(i)

The entity is consolidated into group financial statements prepared by that other
public interest entity; and

(ii)

The firm or a network firm expresses an opinion on those group financial statements.

Considerations for Review Clients
R410.33

This section sets out requirements for a firm to communicate fee-related information of an audit
client that is a public interest entity and to disclose publicly fee-related information to the extent
that the client does not disclose such information. As an exception to those requirements, the
firm may determine not to communicate or pursue disclosure of such information where a review
client is not also an audit client.

A firm’s evaluation or compensation policies might create a self-interest threat. This section sets
out specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework
in such circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
General
411.3 A1

411.3 A2

When an audit team member for a particular audit client is evaluated on or compensated for
selling non-assurance services to that audit client, the level of the self-interest threat will depend
on:
(a)

What proportion of the compensation or evaluation is based on the sale of such services;

(b)

The role of the individual on the audit team; and

(c)

Whether the sale of such non-assurance services influences promotion decisions.

Examples of actions that might eliminate such a self-interest threat include:
•

Revising the compensation plan or evaluation process for that individual.

•

Removing that individual from the audit team.

411.3 A3

An example of an action that might be a safeguard to address such a self-interest threat is having
an appropriate reviewer review the work of the audit team member.

R411.4

A firm shall not evaluate or compensate a key audit partner based on that partner’s success in
selling non-assurance services to the partner’s audit client. This requirement does not preclude
normal profit-sharing arrangements between partners of a firm.

ACTUAL OR THREATENED LITIGATION
Introduction
430.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

430.2

When litigation with an audit client occurs, or appears likely, self-interest and intimidation threats
are created. This section sets out specific application material relevant to applying the conceptual
framework in such circumstances.

Application Material
General
430.3 A1

The relationship between client management and audit team members must be characterised
by complete candour and full disclosure regarding all aspects of a client’s operations. Adversarial
positions might result from actual or threatened litigation between an audit client and the firm, a
network firm or an audit team member. Such adversarial positions might affect management’s
willingness to make complete disclosures and create self-interest and intimidation threats.

430.3 A2

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such threats include:
•

The materiality of the litigation.

•

Whether the litigation relates to a prior audit engagement.

430.3 A3

If the litigation involves an audit team member, an example of an action that might eliminate such
self-interest and intimidation threats is removing that individual from the audit team.

430.3 A4

An example of an action that might be a safeguard to address such self-interest and intimidation
threats is to have an appropriate reviewer review the work performed.

FINANCIAL INTERESTS
Introduction
510.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

510.2

Holding a financial interest in an audit client might create a self-interest threat. This section sets
out specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework
in such circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
General
510.3 A1

A financial interest might be held directly or indirectly through an intermediary such as a collective
investment vehicle, an estate or a trust. When a beneficial owner has control over the
intermediary or ability to influence its investment decisions, the Code defines that financial
interest to be direct. Conversely, when a beneficial owner has no control over the intermediary
or ability to influence its investment decisions, the Code defines that financial interest to be
indirect.

510.3 A2

This section contains references to the “materiality” of a financial interest. In determining whether
such an interest is material to an individual, the combined net worth of the individual and the
individual’s immediate family members may be taken into account.

510.3 A3

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of a self-interest threat created by holding a
financial interest in an audit client include:
•

The role of the individual holding the financial interest.

•

Whether the financial interest is direct or indirect.

•

The materiality of the financial interest.

Financial Interests Held by the Firm, a Network Firm, Audit Team Members and Others
R510.4

Subject to paragraph R510.5, a direct financial interest or a material indirect financial interest in
the audit client shall not be held by:
(a)

The firm or a network firm;

(b)

An audit team member, or any of that individual’s immediate family;

client, except for any whose involvement is minimal, or any of that individual’s immediate
family.

510.4 A1

The office in which the engagement partner practices in connection with an audit engagement is
not necessarily the office to which that partner is assigned. When the engagement partner is
located in a different office from that of the other engagement team members, professional
judgement is needed to determine the office in which the partner practices in connection with the
engagement.

R510.5

As an exception to paragraph R510.4, an immediate family member identified in subparagraphs
R510.4(c) or (d) may hold a direct or material indirect financial interest in an audit client, provided
that:
(a)

The family member received the financial interest because of employment rights, for
example through pension or share option plans, and, when necessary, the firm addresses
the threat created by the financial interest; and

(b)

The family member disposes of or forfeits the financial interest as soon as practicable when
the family member has or obtains the right to do so, or in the case of a stock option, when
the family member obtains the right to exercise the option.

member and that individual’s immediate family member and the audit client, as
applicable; or

(ii)

The audit client cannot exercise significant influence over the entity.

circumstances and the interest would not otherwise be permitted to be held under this section,
then:
(a)

If the interest is received by the firm or a network firm, or an audit team member or any of
that individual’s immediate family, the financial interest shall be disposed of immediately,
or enough of an indirect financial interest shall be disposed of so that the remaining interest
is no longer material; or

(b)

(i)

If the interest is received by an individual who is not an audit team member, or by

Buying Goods or Services
520.6 A1

The purchase of goods and services, including the licensing of technology from an audit client
by a firm, a network firm, an audit team member, or any of that individual’s immediate family does

might range from: administrative duties (such as personnel management and the maintenance
of company records and registers) to duties as diverse as ensuring that the company complies
with regulations or providing advice on corporate governance matters. Usually this position is
seen to imply a close association with the entity. Therefore, a threat is created if a partner or
employee of the firm or a network firm serves as Company Secretary for an audit client. (More

The firm discusses the former partner’s position held with the audit client with those
charged with governance.

SECTION 525
TEMPORARY PERSONNEL ASSIGNMENTS
Introduction
525.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

525.2

The loan of personnel to an audit client might create a self-review, advocacy or familiarity threat.
This section sets out specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the
conceptual framework in such circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
General
525.3 A1

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address threats created by the loan of personnel
by a firm or a network firm to an audit client include:
•

Conducting an additional review of the work performed by the loaned personnel might
address a self-review threat.

•

Not including the loaned personnel as an audit team member might address a familiarity
or advocacy threat.

•

Not giving the loaned personnel audit responsibility for any function or activity that the
personnel performed during the loaned personnel assignment might address a self-review
threat.

525.3 A2

When familiarity and advocacy threats are created by the loan of personnel by a firm or a network
firm to an audit client, such that the firm or the network firm becomes too closely aligned with the
views and interests of management, safeguards are often not available.

R525.4

A firm or network firm shall not loan personnel to an audit client unless the firm or network firm
is satisfied that:
(a)

Such assistance is provided only for a short period of time;

(b)

Such personnel will not assume management responsibilities and the audit client will be
responsible for directing and supervising the activities of the personnel;

(c)

Any threat to the independence of the firm or network firm arising from the professional
services undertaken by such personnel is eliminated or safeguards are applied to reduce
such threat to an acceptable level; and

(d)

Such personnel will not undertake or be involved in professional services that the firm or
network firm is prohibited from performing by the Code.

SECTION 540
LONG ASSOCIATION OF PERSONNEL (INCLUDING PARTNER ROTATION) WITH AN
AUDIT CLIENT
Introduction
540.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

540.2

When an individual is involved in an audit engagement over a long period of time, familiarity and
self-interest threats might be created. This section sets out requirements and application material
relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
All Audit Clients
540.3 A1

Although an understanding of an audit client and its environment is fundamental to audit quality,
a familiarity threat might be created as a result of an individual’s long association as an audit
team member with:
(a)

The audit client and its operations;

(b)

The audit client’s senior management; or

(c)

The financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion or the financial
information which forms the basis of the financial statements.

540.3 A2

A self-interest threat might be created as a result of an individual’s concern about losing a
longstanding client or an interest in maintaining a close personal relationship with a member of
senior management or those charged with governance. Such a threat might influence the
individual’s judgement inappropriately.

540.3 A3

Factors that are relevant to evaluating the level of such familiarity or self-interest threats include:
(a)

(b)

540.3 A4

In relation to the individual:
•

The overall length of the individual’s relationship with the client, including if such
relationship existed while the individual was at a prior firm.

•

How long the individual has been an engagement team member, and the nature of
the roles performed.

•

The extent to which the work of the individual is directed, reviewed and supervised
by more senior personnel.

•

The extent to which the individual, due to the individual’s seniority, has the ability to
influence the outcome of the audit, for example, by making key decisions or directing
the work of other engagement team members.

•

The closeness of the individual’s personal relationship with senior management or
those charged with governance.

•

The nature, frequency and extent of the interaction between the individual and senior
management or those charged with governance.

In relation to the audit client:
•

The nature or complexity of the client’s accounting and financial reporting issues and
whether they have changed.

•

Whether there have been any recent changes in senior management or those
charged with governance.

•

Whether there have been any structural changes in the client’s organisation which
impact the nature, frequency and extent of interactions the individual might have with
senior management or those charged with governance.

The combination of two or more factors might increase or reduce the level of the threats. For
example, familiarity threats created over time by the increasingly close relationship between an
SECTION 540 Page 145 of 226

THE CODE

individual and a member of the client’s senior management would be reduced by the departure
of that member of the client’s senior management.
540.3 A5

An example of an action that might eliminate the familiarity and self-interest threats created by
an individual being involved in an audit engagement over a long period of time would be rotating
the individual off the audit team.

540.3 A6

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such familiarity or self-interest threats
include:

R540.4

•

Changing the role of the individual on the audit team or the nature and extent of the tasks
the individual performs.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not an audit team member review the work of the
individual.

•

Performing regular independent internal or external quality reviews of the engagement.

If a firm decides that the level of the threats created can only be addressed by rotating the
individual off the audit team, the firm shall determine an appropriate period during which the
individual shall not:
(a)

Be a member of the engagement team for the audit engagement;

(b)

Perform an engagement quality review, or a review consistent with the objective of an
engagement quality review, for the engagement; or

(c)

Exert direct influence on the outcome of the audit engagement.

The period shall be of sufficient duration to allow the familiarity and self-interest threats to be
addressed. In the case of a public interest entity, paragraphs R540.5 to R540.21 also apply.
Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
R540.5

Subject to paragraphs R540.7 to R540.9, in respect of an audit of a public interest entity, an
individual shall not act in any of the following roles, or a combination of such roles, for a period
of more than seven cumulative years (the “time-on” period):
(a)

The engagement partner;

(b)

The individual appointed as responsible for performing the engagement quality review; or

(c)

Any other key audit partner role.

After the time-on period, the individual shall serve a “cooling-off” period in accordance with the
provisions in paragraphs R540.11 to R540.19.
R540.6

In calculating the time-on period, the count of years shall not be restarted unless the individual
ceases to act in any one of the roles in paragraph R540.5(a) to (c) for a minimum period. This
minimum period is a consecutive period equal to at least the cooling-off period determined in
accordance with paragraphs R540.11 to R540.13 as applicable to the role in which the individual
served in the year immediately before ceasing such involvement.

540.6 A1

For example, an individual who served as engagement partner for four years followed by three
years off can only act thereafter as a key audit partner on the same audit engagement for three
further years (making a total of seven cumulative years). Thereafter, that individual is required to
cool off in accordance with paragraph R540.15.

R540.7

As an exception to paragraph R540.5, key audit partners whose continuity is especially important
to audit quality may, in rare cases due to unforeseen circumstances outside the firm’s control,
and with the concurrence of those charged with governance, be permitted to serve an additional
year as a key audit partner as long as the threat to independence can be eliminated or reduced
to an acceptable level.

540.7 A1

For example, a key audit partner may remain in that role on the audit team for up to one additional
year in circumstances where, due to unforeseen events, a required rotation was not possible, as
might be the case due to serious illness of the intended engagement partner. In such
circumstances, this will involve the firm discussing with those charged with governance the
reasons why the planned rotation cannot take place and the need for any safeguards to reduce
any threat created.

R540.8

If an audit client becomes a public interest entity, a firm shall take into account the length of time
SECTION 540 Page 146 of 226

THE CODE

an individual has served the audit client as a key audit partner before the client becomes a public
interest entity in determining the timing of the rotation. If the individual has served the audit client
as a key audit partner for a period of five cumulative years or less when the client becomes a
public interest entity, the number of years the individual may continue to serve the client in that
capacity before rotating off the engagement is seven years less the number of years already
served. As an exception to paragraph R540.5, if the individual has served the audit client as a
key audit partner for a period of six or more cumulative years when the client becomes a public
interest entity, the individual may continue to serve in that capacity with the concurrence of those
charged with governance for a maximum of two additional years before rotating off the
engagement.
R540.9

When a firm has only a few people with the necessary knowledge and experience to serve as a
key audit partner on the audit of a public interest entity, rotation of key audit partners might not
be possible. As an exception to paragraph R540.5, if an independent regulatory body in the
relevant jurisdiction has provided an exemption from partner rotation in such circumstances, an
individual may remain a key audit partner for more than seven years, in accordance with such
exemption. This is provided that the independent regulatory body has specified other
requirements which are to be applied, such as the length of time that the key audit partner may
be exempted from rotation or a regular independent external review.

Other Considerations Relating to the Time-on Period
R540.10

In evaluating the threats created by an individual’s long association with an audit engagement, a
firm shall give particular consideration to the roles undertaken and the length of an individual’s
association with the audit engagement prior to the individual becoming a key audit partner.

540.10 A1

There might be situations where the firm, in applying the conceptual framework, concludes that
it is not appropriate for an individual who is a key audit partner to continue in that role even
though the length of time served as a key audit partner is less than seven years.

Cooling-off Period
R540.11

If the individual acted as the engagement partner for seven cumulative years, the cooling-off
period shall be five consecutive years.

R540.12

Where the individual has been appointed as responsible for the engagement quality review and
has acted in that capacity for seven cumulative years, the cooling-off period shall be three
consecutive years.

R540.13

If the individual has acted as a key audit partner other than in the capacities set out in paragraphs
R540.11 and R540.12 for seven cumulative years, the cooling-off period shall be two consecutive
years.

540.14 A1

The partner rotation requirements in this section are distinct from, and do not modify, the coolingoff period required by ISQM 2 as a condition for eligibility before the engagement partner can
assume the role of engagement quality reviewer (see paragraph 325.8 A4).

Service in a combination of key audit partner roles
R540.15

If the individual acted in a combination of key audit partner roles and served as the engagement
partner for four or more cumulative years, the cooling-off period shall be five consecutive years.

R540.16

Subject to paragraph R540.17(a), if the individual acted in a combination of key audit partner
roles and served as the key audit partner responsible for the engagement quality review for four
or more cumulative years, the cooling-off period shall be three consecutive years.

R540.17

If an individual has acted in a combination of engagement partner and engagement quality
reviewer roles for four or more cumulative years during the time-on period, the cooling-off period
shall:

R540.18

(a)

As an exception to paragraph R540.16, be five consecutive years where the individual has
been the engagement partner for three or more years; or

(b)

Be three consecutive years in the case of any other combination.

If the individual acted in any combination of key audit partner roles other than those addressed
in paragraphs R540.15 to R540.17, the cooling-off period shall be two consecutive years.

SECTION 540 Page 147 of 226

THE CODE

Service at a Prior Firm
R540.19

In determining the number of years that an individual has been a key audit partner as set out in
paragraph R540.5, the length of the relationship shall, where relevant, include time while the
individual was a key audit partner on that engagement at a prior firm.

[Paragraphs 540.20 is intentionally left blank]
Restrictions on Activities During the Cooling-off Period
R540.21

540.21 A1

For the duration of the relevant cooling-off period, the individual shall not:
(a)

Be an engagement team member or perform an engagement quality review, or a review
consistent with the objective of an engagement quality review for the audit engagement;

(b)

Consult with the engagement team or the client regarding technical or industry-specific
issues, transactions or events affecting the audit engagement (other than discussions with
the engagement team limited to work undertaken or conclusions reached in the last year
of the individual’s time-on period where this remains relevant to the audit);

(c)

Be responsible for leading or coordinating the professional services provided by the firm
or a network firm to the audit client, or overseeing the relationship of the firm or a network
firm with the audit client; or

(d)

Undertake any other role or activity not referred to above with respect to the audit client,
including the provision of non-assurance services, that would result in the individual:
(i)

Having significant or frequent interaction with senior management or those charged
with governance; or

(ii)

Exerting direct influence on the outcome of the audit engagement.

The provisions of paragraph R540.21 are not intended to prevent the individual from assuming
a leadership role in the firm or a network firm, such as that of the Senior or Managing Partner
(Chief Executive or equivalent).

SECTION 600
PROVISION OF NON-ASSURANCE SERVICES TO AN AUDIT CLIENT
Introduction
600.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent, and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

600.2

Firms and network firms might provide a range of non-assurance services to their audit clients,
consistent with their skills and expertise. Providing non-assurance services to audit clients might
create threats to compliance with the fundamental principles and threats to independence.

600.3

This section sets out requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual
framework to identify, evaluate and address threats to independence when providing nonassurance services to audit clients. The subsections that follow set out specific requirements and
application material that are relevant when a firm or a network firm provides certain types of nonassurance services to audit clients and indicate the types of threats that might be created as a
result.

600.4

Some subsections include requirements that expressly prohibit a firm or a network firm from
providing certain services to an audit client because the threats created cannot be eliminated
and safeguards are not capable of being applied to reduce the threats to an acceptable level.

600.5

New business practices, the evolution of financial markets and changes in technology are some
developments that make it impossible to draw up an all-inclusive list of non-assurance services
that firms and network firms might provide to an audit client. The conceptual framework and the
general provisions in this section apply when a firm proposes to a client to provide a nonassurance service for which there are no specific requirements and application material.

600.6

The requirements and application material in this section apply where a firm or a network firm:
(a)

Uses technology to provide a non-assurance service to an audit client; or

(b)

Provides, sells, resells or licenses technology resulting in the provision of a non-assurance
service by the firm or a network firm:
(i)

To an audit client; or

(ii)

To an entity that provides services using such technology to audit clients of the firm
or network firm.

Requirements and Application Material
General
Non-Assurance Services Provisions in Laws or Regulations
600.7 A1

Paragraphs R100.6 to 100.7 A1 set out requirements and application material relating to
compliance with the Code. If there are laws and regulations in a jurisdiction relating to the
provision of non-assurance services to audit clients that differ from or go beyond those set out in
this section, firms providing non-assurance services to which such provisions apply need to be
aware of those differences and comply with the more stringent provisions.

Risk of Assuming Management Responsibilities when Providing a Non-Assurance Service
600.8 A1

When a firm or a network firm provides a non-assurance service to an audit client, there is a risk
that the firm or network firm will assume a management responsibility unless the firm or network
firm is satisfied that the requirements in paragraph R400.21 have been complied with.

Accepting an Engagement to Provide a Non-Assurance Service
R600.9

Before a firm or a network firm accepts an engagement to provide a non-assurance service to
an audit client, the firm shall apply the conceptual framework to identify, evaluate and address
any threat to independence that might be created by providing that service.

SECTION 600 Page 149 of 226

THE CODE

Identifying and Evaluating Threats
All Audit Clients
600.10 A1

A description of the categories of threats that might arise when a firm or a network firm provides
a non-assurance service to an audit client is set out in paragraph 120.6 A3.

600.10 A2

Factors that are relevant in identifying the different threats that might be created by providing a
non-assurance service to an audit client, and evaluating the level of such threats include:
•

The nature, scope, intended use and purpose of the service.

•

The manner in which the service will be provided, such as the personnel to be involved
and their location.

•

The client’s dependency on the service, including the frequency with which the service will
be provided.

•

The legal and regulatory environment in which the service is provided.

•

Whether the client is a public interest entity.

•

The level of expertise of the client’s management and employees with respect to the type
of service provided.

•

The extent to which the client determines significant matters of judgement. (Ref: Para.
R400.20 to R400.21).

•

Whether the outcome of the service will affect the accounting records or matters reflected
in the financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion, and, if so:

•

600.10 A3

o

The extent to which the outcome of the service will have a material effect on the
financial statements.

o

The degree of subjectivity involved in determining the appropriate amounts or
treatment for those matters reflected in the financial statements.

The nature and extent of the impact of the service, if any, on the systems that generate
information that forms a significant part of the client’s:
o

Accounting records or financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion.

o

Internal controls over financial reporting.

•

The degree of reliance that will be placed on the outcome of the service as part of the
audit.

•

The fee relating to the provision of the non-assurance service.

Subsections 601 to 610 include examples of additional factors that are relevant in identifying
threats to independence created by providing certain non-assurance services and evaluating the
level of such threats.

Materiality in relation to financial statements
600.11 A1

Materiality is a factor that is relevant in evaluating threats created by providing a non- assurance
service to an audit client. Subsections 601 to 610 refer to materiality in relation to an audit client’s
financial statements. The concept of materiality in relation to an audit is addressed in ISA 320,
Materiality in Planning and Performing an Audit, and in relation to a review in ISRE 2400
(Revised), Engagements to Review Historical Financial Statements. The determination of
materiality involves the exercise of professional judgement and is impacted by both quantitative
and qualitative factors. It is also affected by perceptions of the financial information needs of
users.

600.11 A2

Where the Code expressly prohibits the provision of a non-assurance service to an audit client,
a firm or a network firm is not permitted to provide that service, regardless of the materiality of
the outcome or results of the non-assurance service on the financial statements on which the
firm will express an opinion.

Providing advice and recommendations
600.12 A1

Providing advice and recommendations might create a self-review threat. Whether providing
advice and recommendations creates a self-review threat involves making the determination set
SECTION 600 Page 150 of 226

THE CODE

out in paragraph R600.15. Where the audit client is not a public interest entity and a self- review
threat is identified, the firm is required to apply the conceptual framework to evaluate and address
the threat. If the audit client is a public interest entity, paragraphs R600.17 and R600.18 apply.
Multiple non-assurance services provided to the same audit client
R600.13

When a firm or a network firm provides multiple non-assurance services to an audit client, the
firm shall consider whether, in addition to the threats created by each service individually, the
combined effect of such services creates or impacts threats to independence.

600.13 A1

In addition to paragraph 600.10 A2, factors that are relevant in a firm’s evaluation of the level of
threats to independence created where multiple non-assurance services are provided to an audit
client might include whether:
•

The combined effect of providing multiple services increases the level of threat created by
each service assessed individually.

•

The combined effect of providing multiple services increases the level of any threat arising
from the overall relationship with the audit client.

Self-review threats
600.14 A1

When a firm or a network firm provides a non-assurance service to an audit client, there might
be a risk of the firm auditing its own or the network firm’s work, thereby giving rise to a selfreview threat. A self-review threat is the threat that a firm or a network firm will not appropriately
evaluate the results of a previous judgement made or an activity performed by an individual within
the firm or network firm as part of a non-assurance service on which the audit team will rely when
forming a judgement as part of an audit.

R600.15

Before providing a non-assurance service to an audit client, a firm or a network firm shall
determine whether the provision of that service might create a self-review threat by evaluating
whether there is a risk that:
(a)

The results of the service will form part of or affect the accounting records, the internal
controls over financial reporting, or the financial statements on which the firm will express
an opinion; and

(b)

In the course of the audit of those financial statements on which the firm will express an
opinion, the audit team will evaluate or rely on any judgements made or activities
performed by the firm or network firm when providing the service.

Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
600.16 A1

When the audit client is a public interest entity, stakeholders have heightened expectations
regarding the firm’s independence. These heightened expectations are relevant to the
reasonable and informed third party test used to evaluate a self-review threat created by
providing a non-assurance service to an audit client that is a public interest entity.

600.16 A2

Where the provision of a non-assurance service to an audit client that is a public interest entity
creates a self-review threat, that threat cannot be eliminated, and safeguards are not capable of
being applied to reduce that threat to an acceptable level.

Self-review threats
R600.17

A firm or a network firm shall not provide a non-assurance service to an audit client that is a
public interest entity if the provision of that service might create a self-review threat in relation to
the audit of the financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion. (Ref: Para. 600.14
A1 and R600.15).

Providing advice and recommendations
R600.18

As an exception to paragraph R600.17, a firm or a network firm may provide advice and
recommendations to an audit client that is a public interest entity in relation to information or
matters arising in the course of an audit provided that the firm:
(a)

Does not assume a management responsibility (Ref: Para. R400.20 and R400.21); and

(b)

Applies the conceptual framework to identify, evaluate and address threats, other than selfreview threats, to independence that might be created by the provision of that advice.

SECTION 600 Page 151 of 226

THE CODE

600.18 A1

Examples of advice and recommendations that might be provided in relation to information or
matters arising in the course of an audit include:
•

Advising on accounting and financial reporting standards or policies and financial
statement disclosure requirements.

•

Advising on the appropriateness of financial and accounting control and the methods used
in determining the stated amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures.

•

Proposing adjusting journal entries arising from audit findings.

•

Discussing findings on internal controls over financial reporting and processes and
recommending improvements.

•

Discussing how to resolve account reconciliation problems.

•

Advising on compliance with group accounting policies.

Addressing Threats
All Audit Clients
600.19 A1

Paragraphs R120.10 to 120.10 A2 include a requirement and application material that are
relevant when addressing threats to independence, including a description of safeguards.

600.19 A2

Threats to independence created by providing a non-assurance service or multiple services to
an audit client vary depending on the facts and circumstances of the audit engagement and the
nature of the service. Such threats might be addressed by applying safeguards or by adjusting
the scope of the proposed service.

600.19 A3

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:

600.19 A4

•

Using professionals who are not audit team members to perform the service.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in providing the service review the
audit work or service performed.

•

Obtaining pre-clearance of the outcome of the service from an appropriate authority (for
example, a tax authority).

Safeguards might not be available to reduce the threats created by providing a non-assurance
service to an audit client to an acceptable level. In such a situation, the application of the
conceptual framework requires the firm or network firm to:
(a)

Adjust the scope of the proposed service to eliminate the circumstances that are creating
the threats;

(b)

Decline or end the service that creates the threats that cannot be eliminated or reduced to
an acceptable level; or

(c)

End the audit engagement.

Communication with Those Charged with Governance Regarding Non-Assurance Services
All Audit Clients
600.20 A1

Paragraphs 400.40 A1 and 400.40 A2 are relevant to a firm’s communication with those charged
with governance in relation to the provision of non-assurance services.

Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
600.21 A1

Paragraphs R600.22 to R600.24 require a firm to communicate with those charged with
governance of a public interest entity before the firm or network firm provides non-assurance
services to entities within the corporate structure of which the public interest entity forms part that
might create threats to the firm’s independence from the public interest entity. The purpose of the
communication is to enable those charged with governance of the public interest entity to have
effective oversight of the independence of the firm that audits the financial statements of that
public interest entity.

600.21 A2

To facilitate compliance with such requirements, a firm might agree with those charged with
governance of the public interest entity a process that addresses when and with whom the firm
is to communicate. Such a process might:

SECTION 600 Page 152 of 226

THE CODE

R600.22

•

Establish the procedure for the provision of information about a proposed non-assurance
service which might be on an individual engagement basis, under a general policy, or on
any other agreed basis.

•

Identify the entities to which the process would apply, which might include other public
interest entities within the corporate structure.

•

Identify any services that can be provided to the entities identified in paragraph R600.22
without specific approval of those charged with governance if they agree as a general
policy that these services are not prohibited under this section and would not create threats
to the firm’s independence or, if any such threats are created, they would be at an
acceptable level.

•

Establish how those charged with governance of multiple public interest entities within the
same corporate structure have determined that authority for approving services is to be
allocated.

•

Establish a procedure to be followed where the provision of information necessary for
those charged with governance to evaluate whether a proposed service might create a
threat to the firm’s independence is prohibited or limited by professional standards, laws
or regulations, or might result in the disclosure of sensitive or confidential information.

•

Specify how any issues not covered by the process might be resolved.

Before a firm that audits the financial statements of a public interest entity, or a network firm
accepts an engagement to provide a non-assurance service to:
(A)

That public interest entity;

(B)

Any entity that controls, directly or indirectly, that public interest entity; or

(C)

Any entity that is controlled directly or indirectly by that public interest entity,

the firm shall, unless already addressed when establishing a process agreed with those charged
with governance:
(a)

(b)

600.22 A1

R600.23

Inform those charged with governance of the public interest entity that the firm has
determined that the provision of the service:
(i)

Is not prohibited; and

(ii)

Will not create a threat to the firm’s independence as auditor of the public interest
entity or that any identified threat is at an acceptable level or, if not, will be eliminated
or reduced to an acceptable level; and

Provide those charged with governance of the public interest entity with information to
enable them to make an informed assessment about the impact of the provision of the
service on the firm’s independence.

Examples of information that might be provided to those charged with governance of the public
interest entity in relation to a particular non-assurance service include:
•

The nature and scope of the service to be provided.

•

The basis and amount of the proposed fee.

•

Where the firm has identified any threats to independence that might be created by the
provision of the proposed service, the basis for the firm’s assessment that the threats are
at an acceptable level or, if not, the actions the firm or network firm will take to eliminate or
reduce any threats to independence to an acceptable level.

•

Whether the combined effect of providing multiple services creates threats to
independence or changes the level of previously identified threats.

A firm or a network firm shall not provide a non-assurance service to any of the entities referred
to in paragraph R600.22 unless those charged with governance of the public interest entity have
concurred either under a process agreed with those charged with governance or in relation to a

(a)

The firm’s conclusion that the provision of the service will not create a threat to the firm’s

R600.25

The provision of that service.

As an exception to paragraphs R600.22 and R600.23, where a firm is prohibited by applicable
professional standards, laws or regulations from providing information about the proposed nonassurance service to those charged with governance of the public interest entity, or where the
provision of such information would result in disclosure of sensitive or confidential information,
the firm may provide the proposed service provided that:
(a)

The firm provides such information as it is able without breaching its legal or professional
obligations;

(b)

The firm informs those charged with governance of the public interest entity that the
provision of the service will not create a threat to the firm’s independence from the public
interest entity, or that any identified threat is at an acceptable level or, if not, will be
eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level; and

(c)

Those charged with governance do not disagree with the firm’s conclusion in (b).

The firm or the network firm, having taken into account any matters raised by those charged with
governance of the audit client that is a public interest entity or by the entity referred to in
paragraph R600.22 that is the recipient of the proposed service, shall decline the non- assurance
service or the firm shall end the audit engagement if:
(a)

The firm or the network firm is not permitted to provide any information to those charged
with governance of the audit client that is a public interest entity, unless such a situation is
addressed in a process agreed in advance with those charged with governance; or

(b)

Those charged with governance of an audit client that is a public interest entity disagree
with the firm’s conclusion that the provision of the service will not create a threat to the
firm’s independence from the client or that any identified threat is at an acceptable level
or, if not, will be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level.

Audit Client that Later Becomes a Public Interest Entity
R600.26

600.26 A1

A non-assurance service provided, either currently or previously, by a firm or a network firm to
an audit client compromises the firm’s independence when the client becomes a public interest
entity unless:
(a)

The previous non-assurance service complies with the provisions of this section that relate
to audit clients that are not public interest entities;

(b)

Non-assurance services currently in progress that are not permitted under this section for
audit clients that are public interest entities are ended before or, if that is not possible, as
soon as practicable after, the client becomes a public interest entity; and

(c)

The firm and those charged with governance of the client that becomes a public interest
entity agree and take further actions to address any threats to independence that are not
at an acceptable level.

Examples of actions that the firm might recommend to the audit client include engaging another
firm to:
•

Review or re-perform the affected audit work to the extent necessary.

•

Evaluate the results of the non-assurance service or re-perform the non-assurance service
to the extent necessary to enable the other firm to take responsibility for the service.

Considerations for Certain Related Entities
R600.27

This section includes requirements that prohibit firms and network firms from providing certain
non- assurance services to audit clients. As an exception to those requirements and the
requirement in paragraph R400.20, a firm or a network firm may assume management
responsibilities or provide certain non-assurance services that would otherwise be prohibited to
the following related entities of the client on whose financial statements the firm will express an
opinion:
(a)

An entity that has direct or indirect control over the client;

(b)

An entity with a direct financial interest in the client if that entity has significant influence
over the client and the interest in the client is material to such entity; or

SECTION 600 Page 154 of 226

(c)

An entity which is under common control with the client,

provided that all of the following conditions are met:
(i)

The firm or a network firm does not express an opinion on the financial statements
of the related entity;

(ii)

The firm or a network firm does not assume a management responsibility, directly
or indirectly, for the entity on whose financial statements the firm will express an
opinion;

(iii)

The services do not create a self-review threat; and

(iv)

The firm addresses other threats created by providing such services that are not at
an acceptable level.

Documentation
600.28 A1

Documentation of the firm’s conclusions regarding compliance with this section in accordance

•

Key elements of the firm’s understanding of the nature of the non-assurance service to be
provided and whether and how the service might impact the financial statements on which
the firm will express an opinion.

•

The nature of any threat to independence that is created by providing the service to the
audit client, including whether the results of the service will be subject to audit procedures.

•

The extent of management’s involvement in the provision and oversight of the proposed
non-assurance service.

•

Any safeguards that are applied, or other actions taken to address a threat to
independence.

•

The firm’s rationale for determining that the service is not prohibited and that any identified
threat to independence is at an acceptable level.

when there is a risk that the results of the services will affect the accounting records or the
financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion.

Audit Clients that are Not Public Interest Entities
R601.5

601.5 A1

A firm or a network firm shall not provide to an audit client that is not a public interest entity

financial statements of that public interest entity.

SUBSECTION 602 – ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES
Introduction
602.1

In addition to the specific application material in this subsection, the requirements and application
material in paragraphs 600.1 to 600.28 A1 are relevant to applying the conceptual framework
when providing administrative services.

Application Material
Description of Service

•

Word processing or document formatting.

•

Preparing administrative or statutory forms for client approval.

•

Submitting such forms as instructed by the client.

•

Monitoring statutory filing dates and advising an audit client of those dates.

Potential Threats Arising from the Provision of Administrative Services
All Audit Clients
602.3 A1

Providing administrative services to an audit client does not usually create a threat when such
services are clerical in nature and require little to no professional judgement.

SUBSECTION 603 – VALUATION SERVICES
Introduction
603.1

In addition to the specific requirements and application material in this subsection, the
requirements and application material in paragraphs 600.1 to 600.28 A1 are relevant to applying
the conceptual framework when providing valuation services to an audit client.

SECTION 600 Page 157 of 226

THE CODE

Requirements and Application Material
Description of Service
603.2 A1

A valuation comprises the making of assumptions with regard to future developments, the
application of appropriate methodologies and techniques and the combination of both to compute
a certain value, or range of values, for an asset, a liability or for the whole or part of an entity.

603.2 A2

If a firm or a network firm is requested to perform a valuation to assist an audit client with its tax
reporting obligations or for tax planning purposes and the results of the valuation have no effect
on the accounting records or the financial statements other than through accounting entries
related to tax, the requirements and application material set out in paragraphs 604.17 A1 to
604.19 A1, relating to such services, apply.

Potential Threats Arising from the Provision of Valuation Services
All Audit Clients
603.3 A1

Providing a valuation service to an audit client might create a self-review threat when there is a
risk that the results of the service will affect the accounting records or the financial statements
on which the firm will express an opinion. Such a service might also create an advocacy threat.

603.3 A2

Factors that are relevant in identifying self-review or advocacy threats created by providing
valuation services to an audit client, and evaluating the level of such threats include:
•

The use and purpose of the valuation report.

•

Whether the valuation report will be made public.

•

The extent to which the valuation methodology is supported by law or regulation, other
precedent or established practice.

•

The extent of the client’s involvement in determining and approving the valuation
methodology and other significant matters of judgement.

•

The degree of subjectivity inherent in the item for valuations involving standard or
established methodologies.

•

Whether the valuation will have a material effect on the financial statements.

•

The extent of the disclosures related to the valuation in the financial statements.

•

The volatility of the amounts involved as a result of dependence on future events.

When a self-review threat for an audit client that is a public interest entity has been identified,
paragraph R603.5 applies.
Audit Clients that are Not Public Interest Entities
603.3 A3

R603.4

603.4 A1

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address self-review or advocacy threats created
by providing a valuation service to an audit client that is not a public interest entity include:
•

Using professionals who are not audit team members to perform the service might address
self-review or advocacy threats.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in providing the service review the
audit work or service performed might address a self-review threat.

A firm or a network firm shall not provide a valuation service to an audit client that is not a public
interest entity if:
(a)

The valuation involves a significant degree of subjectivity; and

(b)

The valuation will have a material effect on the financial statements on which the firm will
express an opinion.

Certain valuations do not involve a significant degree of subjectivity. This is likely to be the case
when the underlying assumptions are established by law or regulation or when the techniques
and methodologies to be used are based on generally accepted standards or prescribed by law
or regulation. In such circumstances, the results of a valuation performed by two or more parties
are not likely to be materially different.

Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
Self-review Threats
R603.5

A firm or a network firm shall not provide a valuation service to an audit client that is a public
interest entity if the provision of such valuation service might create a self-review threat. (Ref:
Para. R600.15 and R600.17).

Advocacy Threats
603.5 A1

An example of an action that might be a safeguard to address an advocacy threat created by
providing a valuation service to an audit client that is a public interest entity is using professionals
who are not audit team members to perform the service.

SUBSECTION 604 – TAX SERVICES
Introduction
604.1

In addition to the specific requirements and application material in this subsection, the
requirements and application material in paragraphs 600.1 to 600.28 A1 are relevant to applying
the conceptual framework when providing a tax service to an audit client.

Requirements and Application Material
Description of Service
604.2 A1

604.2 A2

Tax services comprise a broad range of services. This subsection deals specifically with:
•

Tax return preparation.

•

Tax calculations for the purpose of preparing accounting entries.

•

Tax advisory services.

•

Tax planning services.

•

Tax services involving valuations.

•

Assistance in the resolution of tax disputes.

It is possible to consider tax services under broad headings, such as tax planning or compliance.
However, such services are often interrelated in practice and might be combined with other types
of non-assurance services provided by the firm such as corporate finance services. It is,
therefore, impracticable to categorise generically the threats to which specific tax services give
rise.

Potential Threats Arising from the Provision of Tax Services
604.3 A1

Providing tax services to an audit client might create a self-review threat when there is a risk that
the results of the services will affect the accounting records or the financial statements on which
the firm will express an opinion. Such services might also create an advocacy threat.

604.3 A2

Factors that are relevant in identifying self-review or advocacy threats created by providing any
tax service to an audit client, and evaluating the level of such threats include:
•

The particular characteristics of the engagement.

•

The level of tax expertise of the client’s employees.

•

The system by which the tax authorities assess and administer the tax in question and the
role of the firm or network firm in that process.

•

The complexity of the relevant tax regime and the degree of judgement necessary in
applying it.

SECTION 600 Page 159 of 226

THE CODE

All Audit Clients
R604.4

A firm or a network firm shall not provide a tax service or recommend a transaction to an audit
client if the service or transaction relates to marketing, planning, or opining in favour of a tax
treatment that was initially recommended, directly or indirectly, by the firm or network firm, and a
significant purpose of the tax treatment or transaction is tax avoidance, unless the firm is
confident that the proposed treatment has a basis in applicable tax law or regulation that is likely
to prevail.

604.4 A1

Unless the tax treatment has a basis in applicable tax law or regulation that the firm is confident
is likely to prevail, providing the non-assurance service described in paragraph R604.4 creates
self-interest, self-review and advocacy threats that cannot be eliminated and safeguards are not
capable of being applied to reduce such threats to an acceptable level.

A. Tax Return Preparation
Description of Service
604.5 A1

Tax return preparation services include:
•

Assisting clients with their tax reporting obligations by drafting and compiling information,
including the amount of tax due (usually on standardised forms) required to be submitted
to the applicable tax authorities.

•

Advising on the tax return treatment of past transactions.

•

Responding on behalf of the audit client to the tax authorities’ requests for additional
information and analysis (for example, providing explanations of and technical support for
the approach being taken).

Potential Threats Arising from the Provision of Tax Return Preparation Services
All Audit Clients
604.6 A1

Providing tax return preparation services does not usually create a threat because:
(a)

Tax return preparation services are based on historical information and principally involve
analysis and presentation of such historical information under existing tax law, including
precedents and established practice; and

(b)

Tax returns are subject to whatever review or approval process the tax authority considers
appropriate.

B. Tax Calculations for the Purpose of Preparing Accounting Entries
Description of Service
604.7 A1

Tax calculation services involves the preparation of calculations of current and deferred tax
liabilities or assets for the purpose of preparing accounting entries supporting tax assets or
liabilities in the financial statements of the audit client.

Potential Threats Arising from the Provision of Tax Calculation Services
All Audit Clients
604.8 A1

Preparing tax calculations of current and deferred tax liabilities (or assets) for an audit client for
the purpose of preparing accounting entries that support such balances creates a self- review
threat.

Audit Clients that are Not Public Interest Entities
604.9 A1

In addition to the factors in paragraph 604.3 A2, a factor that is relevant in evaluating the level of
self-review threat created when preparing such calculations for an audit client is whether the
calculation might have a material effect on the financial statements on which the firm will express
an opinion.

604.9 A2

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-review threat when the audit
client is not a public interest entity include:
•

Using professionals who are not audit team members to perform the service.
SECTION 600 Page 160 of 226

THE CODE

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in providing the service review the
audit work or service performed.

Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities

A firm or a network firm shall not prepare tax calculations of current and deferred tax liabilities
(or assets) for an audit client that is a public interest entity. (Ref: Para. R600.15 and R600.17).

C. Tax Advisory and Tax Planning Services
Description of Service
604.11 A1

Tax advisory and tax planning services comprise a broad range of services, such as advising the
audit client how to structure its affairs in a tax efficient manner or advising on the application of a tax
law or regulation.

Potential Threats Arising from the Provision of Tax Advisory and Tax Planning Services
All Audit Clients
604.12 A1

Providing tax advisory and tax planning services to an audit client might create a self-review
threat when there is a risk that the results of the services will affect the accounting records or the
financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion. Such services might also create
an advocacy threat.

604.12 A2

Providing tax advisory and tax planning services will not create a self-review threat if such
services:

604.12 A3

(a)

Are supported by a tax authority or other precedent;

(b)

Are based on an established practice (being a practice that has been commonly used and
has not been challenged by the relevant tax authority); or

(c)

Have a basis in tax law that the firm is confident is likely to prevail.

In addition to paragraph 604.3 A2, factors that are relevant in identifying self-review or advocacy
threats created by providing tax advisory and tax planning services to audit clients, and
evaluating the level of such threats include:
•

The degree of subjectivity involved in determining the appropriate treatment for the tax
advice in the financial statements.

•

Whether the tax treatment is supported by a ruling or has otherwise been cleared by the
tax authority before the preparation of the financial statements.

•

The extent to which the outcome of the tax advice might have a material effect on the
financial statements.

When a self-review threat for an audit client that is a public interest entity has been identified,
paragraph R604.15 applies.
When Effectiveness of Tax Advice Is Dependent on a Particular Accounting Treatment or Presentation
R604.13

A firm or a network firm shall not provide tax advisory and tax planning services to an audit client
when:
(a)

The effectiveness of the tax advice depends on a particular accounting treatment or
presentation in the financial statements; and

(b)

The audit team has doubt as to the appropriateness of the related accounting treatment or
presentation under the relevant financial reporting framework.

Audit Clients that are Not Public Interest Entities

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address self-review or advocacy threats created
by providing tax advisory and tax planning services to an audit client that is not a public interest
entity include:
•

Using professionals who are not audit team members to perform the service might address
self-review or advocacy threats.

SECTION 600 Page 161 of 226

THE CODE

•

Having an appropriate reviewer, who was not involved in providing the service, review the
audit work or service performed might address a self-review threat.

•

Obtaining pre-clearance from the tax authorities might address self-review or advocacy
threats.

Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
Self-review Threats
R604.15

A firm or a network firm shall not provide tax advisory and tax planning services to an audit client
that is a public interest entity if the provision of such services might create a self-review threat.

Advocacy Threats
604.15 A1

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address an advocacy threat created by providing
tax advisory and tax planning services to an audit client that is a public interest entity include:
•

Using professionals who are not audit team members to perform the service.

•

Obtaining pre-clearance from the tax authorities.

D. Tax Services Involving Valuations
Description of Service
604.16 A1

The provision of tax services involving valuations might arise in a range of circumstances
including:
•

Merger and acquisition transactions.

•

Group restructurings and corporate reorganisations.

•

Transfer pricing studies.

•

Stock-based compensation arrangements.

Potential Threats Arising from the Provision of Tax Services involving Valuations
All Audit Clients
604.17 A1

Providing a valuation for tax purposes to an audit client might create a self-review threat when
there is a risk that the results of the service will affect the accounting records or the financial
statements on which the firm will express an opinion. Such a service might also create an
advocacy threat.

604.17 A2

When a firm or a network firm performs a valuation for tax purposes to assist an audit client with
its tax reporting obligations or for tax planning purposes, the result of the valuation might:

604.17 A3

(a)

Have no effect on the accounting records or the financial statements other than through
accounting entries related to tax. In such situations, the requirements and application
material set out in this subsection apply.

(b)

Affect the accounting records or the financial statements in ways not limited to accounting
entries related to tax, for example, if the valuation leads to a revaluation of assets. In such
situations, the requirements and application material set out in subsection 603 relating to
valuation services apply.

Performing a valuation for tax purposes for an audit client will not create a self-review threat if:
(a)

The underlying assumptions are either established by law or regulation, or are widely
accepted; or

(b)

The techniques and methodologies to be used are based on generally accepted standards
or prescribed by law or regulation, and the valuation is subject to external review by a tax
authority or similar regulatory authority.

SECTION 600 Page 162 of 226

THE CODE

Audit Clients that are Not Public Interest Entities
604.18 A1

A firm or a network firm might perform a valuation for tax purposes for an audit client that is not
a public interest entity where the result of the valuation only affects the accounting records or the
financial statements through accounting entries related to tax. This would not usually create
threats if the effect on the financial statements is immaterial or the valuation, as incorporated in
a tax return or other filing, is subject to external review by a tax authority or similar regulatory
authority.

604.18 A2

If the valuation that is performed for tax purposes is not subject to an external review and the
effect is material to the financial statements, in addition to paragraph 604.3 A2, the following
factors are relevant in identifying self-review or advocacy threats created by providing those
services to an audit client that is not a public interest entity, and evaluating the level of such
threats:

604.18 A3

•

The extent to which the valuation methodology is supported by tax law or regulation, other
precedent or established practice.

•

The degree of subjectivity inherent in the valuation.

•

The reliability and extent of the underlying data.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats for an audit client that is
not a public interest entity include:
•

Using professionals who are not audit team members to perform the service might address
self-review or advocacy threats.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in providing the service review the
audit work or service performed might address a self-review threat.

•

Obtaining pre-clearance from the tax authorities might address self-review or advocacy
threats.

Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
Self-review Threats
R604.19

A firm or a network firm shall not perform a valuation for tax purposes for an audit client that is a
public interest entity if the provision of that service might create a self-review threat. (Ref: Para.
R600.15, R600.17, 604.17 A3).

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address an advocacy threat created by providing
a valuation for tax purposes for an audit client that is a public interest entity include:
•

Using professionals who are not audit team members to perform the service.

•

Obtaining pre-clearance from the tax authorities.

E. Assistance in the Resolution of Tax Disputes
Description of Service
604.20 A1

A non-assurance service to provide assistance to an audit client in the resolution of tax disputes
might arise from a tax authority’s consideration of tax calculations and treatments. Such a service
might include, for example, providing assistance when the tax authorities have notified the client
that arguments on a particular issue have been rejected and either the tax authority or the client
refers the matter for determination in a formal proceeding before a tribunal or court.

and evaluating the level of such threats include:
•

The role management plays in the resolution of the dispute.

•

The extent to which the outcome of the dispute will have a material effect on the financial
statements on which the firm will express an opinion.

•

Whether the firm or network firm provided the advice that is the subject of the tax dispute.

•

The extent to which the matter is supported by tax law or regulation, other precedent, or
established practice.

•

Whether the proceedings are conducted in public.

SUBSECTION 605 – INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES
Introduction
605.1

In addition to the specific requirements and application material in this subsection, the
requirements and application material in paragraphs 600.1 to 600.28 A1 are relevant to applying
the conceptual framework when providing an internal audit service to an audit client.

Requirements and Application Material
Description of Service
605.2 A1

605.2 A2

Internal audit services comprise a broad range of activities and might involve assisting the audit
client in the performance of one or more aspects of its internal audit activities. Internal audit
activities might include:
•

Monitoring of internal control – reviewing controls, monitoring their operation and
recommending improvements to them.

•

Examining financial and operating information by:
o

Reviewing the means used to identify, measure, classify and report financial and
operating information.

o

Inquiring specifically into individual items including detailed testing of transactions,
balances and procedures.

•

Reviewing the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of operating activities including nonfinancial activities of an entity.

•

Reviewing compliance with:
o

Laws, regulations and other external requirements.

o

Management policies, directives and other internal requirements.

The scope and objectives of internal audit activities vary widely and depend on the size and
structure of the entity and the requirements of those charged with governance as well as the
needs and expectations of management. As they might involve matters that are operational in
nature, they do not necessarily relate to matters that will be subject to consideration in relation
to the audit of the financial statements.

Risk of Assuming Management Responsibility When Providing an Internal Audit Service
R605.3

Paragraph R400.20 precludes a firm or a network firm from assuming a management
responsibility. When providing an internal audit service to an audit client, the firm shall be
satisfied that:
(a)

The client designates an appropriate and competent resource, who reports to those
charged with governance to:
(i)

Be responsible at all times for internal audit activities; and

(ii)

Acknowledge responsibility for designing, implementing, monitoring and maintaining
internal control;

(b)

The client reviews, assesses and approves the scope, risk and frequency of the internal
audit services;

(c)

The client evaluates the adequacy of the internal audit services and the findings resulting
from their performance;

(d)

The client evaluates and determines which recommendations resulting from internal audit
services to implement and manages the implementation process; and

(e)

The client reports to those charged with governance the significant findings and
recommendations resulting from the internal audit services.

SECTION 600 Page 165 of 226

THE CODE

605.3 A1

Performing part of the client’s internal audit activities increases the possibility that individuals
within the firm or the network firm providing internal audit services will assume a management
responsibility.

605.3 A2

Examples of internal audit services that involve assuming management responsibilities include:
•

Setting internal audit policies or the strategic direction of internal audit activities.

•

Directing and taking responsibility for the actions of the entity’s internal audit employees.

•

Deciding which recommendations resulting from internal audit activities to implement.

•

Reporting the results of the internal audit activities to those charged with governance on
behalf of management.

•

Performing procedures that form part of the internal control, such as reviewing and
approving changes to employee data access privileges.

•

Taking responsibility for designing, implementing, monitoring and maintaining internal
control.

•

Performing outsourced internal audit services, comprising all or a substantial portion of the
internal audit function, where the firm or network firm is responsible for determining the
scope of the internal audit work; and might have responsibility for one or more of the
matters noted above.

Potential Threats Arising from the Provision of Internal Audit Services
All Audit Clients
605.4 A1

Providing internal audit services to an audit client might create a self-review threat when there is
a risk that the results of the services impact the audit of the financial statements on which the
firm will express an opinion.

605.4 A2

When a firm uses the work of an internal audit function in an audit engagement, ISAs require the
performance of procedures to evaluate the adequacy of that work. Similarly, when a firm or a
network firm accepts an engagement to provide internal audit services to an audit client, the
results of those services might be used in conducting the external audit. This might create a selfreview threat because it is possible that the engagement team will use the results of the internal
audit service for purposes of the audit engagement without:

605.4 A3

(a)

Appropriately evaluating those results; or

(b)

Exercising the same level of professional scepticism as would be exercised when the
internal audit work is performed by individuals who are not members of the firm.

Factors that are relevant in identifying a self-review threat created by providing internal audit
services to an audit client, and evaluating the level of such a threat include:
•

The materiality of the related financial statements amounts.

•

The risk of misstatement of the assertions related to those financial statement amounts.

•

The degree of reliance that the engagement team will place on the work of the internal
audit service.

When a self-review threat for an audit client that is a public interest entity has been identified,
paragraph R605.6 applies.
Audit Clients that are Not Public Interest Entities
605.5 A1

An example of an action that might be a safeguard to address a self-review threat created by the
provision of an internal audit service to an audit client that is not a public interest entity is using
professionals who are not audit team members to perform the service.

Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities
R605.6

A firm or a network firm shall not provide internal audit services to an audit client that is a public
interest entity if the provision of such services might create a self-review threat. (Ref: Para.

Risk of Assuming Management Responsibility When Providing an IT Systems Service
R606.3

606.3 A1

Paragraph R400.20 precludes a firm or a network firm from assuming a management
responsibility. When providing IT systems services to an audit client, the firm or network firm
shall be satisfied that:
(a)

The client acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and monitoring a system of
internal controls;

(b)

The client, through a competent individual (or individuals), preferably within senior
management, makes all management decisions that are the proper responsibility of
management with respect to the design, development, implementation, operation,
maintenance, monitoring, updating or upgrading of the IT systems;

(c)

The client evaluates the adequacy and results of the design, development, implementation,
operation, maintenance, monitoring, updating or upgrading of the IT system; and

(d)

The client is responsible for operating the IT system and for the data it generates and uses.

Examples of IT systems services that result in the assumption of a management responsibility
include where a firm or a network firm:
•

Stores data or manages (directly or indirectly) the hosting of data on behalf of the audit
client. Such services include:

The nature of the client’s IT systems and the extent to which the IT systems service impacts
or interacts with the client’s accounting records, internal controls over financial reporting
or financial statements.

•

The degree of reliance that will be placed on the particular IT systems as part of the audit.

When a self-review threat for an audit client that is a public interest entity has been identified,
paragraph R606.6 applies.
606.4 A3

Examples of IT systems services that create a self-review threat when they form part of or affect
an audit client’s accounting records or system of internal control over financial reporting include:

RESTRICTION ON USE AND DISTRIBUTION (AUDIT AND REVIEW ENGAGEMENTS)

Introduction
800.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

800.2

This section sets out certain modifications to Part 4A which are permitted in certain
circumstances involving audits of special purpose financial statements where the report includes
a restriction on use and distribution. In this section, an engagement to issue a restricted use and
distribution report in the circumstances set out in paragraph R800.3 is referred to as an “eligible
audit engagement.”

Requirements and Application Material
General
R800.3

When a firm intends to issue a report on an audit of special purpose financial statements which
includes a restriction on use and distribution, the independence requirements set out in Part 4A
shall be eligible for the modifications that are permitted by this section, but only if:
(a)

The firm communicates with the intended users of the report regarding the modified
independence requirements that are to be applied in providing the service; and

(b)

The intended users of the report understand the purpose and limitations of the report and
explicitly agree to the application of the modifications.

800.3 A1

The intended users of the report might obtain an understanding of the purpose and limitations of
the report by participating, either directly, or indirectly through a representative who has authority
to act for the intended users, in establishing the nature and scope of the engagement. In either
case, this participation helps the firm to communicate with intended users about independence
matters, including the circumstances that are relevant to applying the conceptual framework. It
also allows the firm to obtain the agreement of the intended users to the modified independence
requirements.

R800.4

Where the intended users are a class of users who are not specifically identifiable by name at
the time the engagement terms are established, the firm shall subsequently make such users
aware of the modified independence requirements agreed to by their representative.

800.4 A1

For example, where the intended users are a class of users such as lenders in a syndicated loan
arrangement, the firm might describe the modified independence requirements in an engagement
letter to the representative of the lenders. The representative might then make the firm’s
engagement letter available to the members of the group of lenders to meet the requirement for
the firm to make such users aware of the modified independence requirements agreed to by the
representative.

R800.5

When the firm performs an eligible audit engagement, any modifications to Part 4A shall be limited
to those set out in paragraphs R800.7 to R800.14. The firm shall not apply these modifications
when an audit of financial statements is required by law or regulation.

R800.6

If the firm also issues an audit report that does not include a restriction on use and distribution
for the same client, the firm shall apply Part 4A to that audit engagement.

Public Interest Entities
R800.7

When the firm performs an eligible audit engagement, the firm does not need to apply the
independence requirements set out in Part 4A that apply only to public interest entity audit
engagements.

Related Entities
R800.8

When the firm performs an eligible audit engagement, references to “audit client” in Part 4A do
not need to include its related entities. However, when the audit team knows or has reason to
believe that a relationship or circumstance involving a related entity of the client is relevant to the

SECTION 800 Page 176 of 226

THE CODE

evaluation of the firm’s independence of the client, the audit team shall include that related entity
when identifying, evaluating and addressing threats to independence.
Networks and Network Firms
R800.9

When the firm performs an eligible audit engagement, the specific requirements regarding
network firms set out in Part 4A do not need to be applied. However, when the firm knows or has
reason to believe that threats to independence are created by any interests and relationships of
a network firm, the firm shall evaluate and address any such threat.

Financial Interests, Loans and Guarantees, Close Business Relationships, and Family and Personal
Relationships
R800.10

When the firm performs an eligible audit engagement:
(a)

The relevant provisions set out in Sections 510, 511, 520, 521, 522, 524 and 525 need
apply only to the members of the engagement team, their immediate family members and,
where applicable, close family members;

(b)

The firm shall identify, evaluate and address any threats to independence created by
interests and relationships, as set out in Sections 510, 511, 520, 521, 522, 524 and 525,
between the audit client and the following audit team members:

(c)

(i)

Those who provide consultation regarding technical or industry-specific issues,
transactions or events; and

(ii)

Those who perform an engagement quality review, or a review consistent with the
objective of an engagement quality review, for the engagement; and

The firm shall evaluate and address any threats that the engagement team has reason to
believe are created by interests and relationships between the audit client and others within
the firm who can directly influence the outcome of the audit engagement.

800.10 A1

Others within a firm who can directly influence the outcome of the audit engagement include those
who recommend the compensation, or who provide direct supervisory, management or other
oversight, of the audit engagement partner in connection with the performance of the audit
engagement including those at all successively senior levels above the engagement partner
through to the individual who is the firm’s Senior or Managing Partner (Chief Executive or
equivalent).

R800.11

When the firm performs an eligible audit engagement, the firm shall evaluate and address any
threats that the engagement team has reason to believe are created by financial interests in the
audit client held by individuals, as set out in paragraphs R510.4(c) and (d), R510.5, R510.7 and
510.10 A5 and A9.

R800.12

When the firm performs an eligible audit engagement, the firm, in applying the provisions set out
in paragraphs R510.4(a), R510.6 and R510.7 to interests of the firm, shall not hold a material
direct or a material indirect financial interest in the audit client.

Employment with an Audit Client
R800.13

When the firm performs an eligible audit engagement, the firm shall evaluate and address any
threats created by any employment relationships as set out in paragraphs 524.3 A1 to 524.5 A3.

Providing Non-Assurance Services
R800.14

If the firm performs an eligible audit engagement and provides a non-assurance service to the
audit client, the firm shall comply with Sections 410 to 430 and Section 600, including its
subsections, subject to paragraphs R800.7 to R800.9.

PART 4B – INDEPENDENCE FOR ASSURANCE
ENGAGEMENTS OTHER THAN AUDIT AND REVIEW ENGAGEMENTS
SECTION 900
APPLYING THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO INDEPENDENCE FOR
ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENTS OTHER THAN AUDIT AND REVIEW ENGAGEMENTS
Introduction
General
900.1

This Part applies to assurance engagements other than audit engagements and review
engagements. Examples of such engagements include:
•

Assurance on an entity’s key performance indicators.

•

Assurance on an entity’s compliance with law or regulation.

•

Assurance on performance criteria, such as value for money, achieved by a public sector
body.

•

Assurance on the effectiveness of an entity’s system of internal control.

•

Assurance on an entity’s non-financial information, for example, environmental, social and
governance disclosures, including greenhouse gas statements.

•

An audit of specific elements, accounts or items of a financial statement.

900.2

In this Part, the term “professional accountant” refers to individual professional accountants in
public practice and their firms.

900.3

ISQM 1 requires a firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management for
assurance engagements performed by the firm. As part of this system of quality management,
ISQM 1 requires the firm to establish quality objectives that address the fulfilment of
responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements, including those related to
independence. Under ISQM 1, relevant ethical requirements are those related to the firm, its
personnel and, when applicable, others subject to the independence requirements to which the
firm and the firm’s engagements are subject. In addition, ISAEs and ISAs establish
responsibilities for engagement partners and engagement teams at the level of the engagement.
The allocation of responsibilities within a firm will depend on its size, structure and organisation.
Many of the provisions of Part 4B do not prescribe the specific responsibility of individuals within
the firm for actions related to independence, instead referring to “firm” for ease of reference. A
firm assigns operational responsibility for compliance with independence requirements to an
individual(s) in accordance with ISQM 1. Additionally, an individual professional accountant
remains responsible for compliance with any provisions that apply to that accountant’s activities,
interests or relationships.

900.4

Independence is linked to the principles of objectivity and integrity. It comprises:
(a)

Independence of mind – the state of mind that permits the expression of a conclusion
without being affected by influences that compromise professional judgement, thereby
allowing an individual to act with integrity, and exercise objectivity and professional
scepticism.

(b)

Independence in appearance – the avoidance of facts and circumstances that are so
significant that a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that a
firm’s or an assurance team member’s integrity, objectivity or professional scepticism has
been compromised.

In this Part, references to an individual or firm being “independent” mean that the individual or firm
has complied with the provisions of this Part.
900.5

When performing assurance engagements, the Code requires firms to comply with the
fundamental principles and be independent. This Part sets out specific requirements and
application material on how to apply the conceptual framework to maintain independence when
performing assurance engagements other than audit or review engagements. The conceptual
framework set out in Section 120 applies to independence as it does to the fundamental
principles set out in Section 110.
SECTION 900 Page 179 of 226

THE CODE

900.6

This Part describes:
(a)

Facts and circumstances, including professional activities, interests and relationships, that
create or might create threats to independence;

(b)

Potential actions, including safeguards, that might be appropriate to address any such
threats; and

(c)

Some situations where the threats cannot be eliminated or there can be no safeguards to
reduce the threats to an acceptable level.

Description of Assurance Engagements
900.7

In an assurance engagement, the firm aims to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence in order to
express a conclusion designed to enhance the degree of confidence of the intended users other
than the responsible party about the subject matter information. ISAE 3000 (Revised) describes
the elements and objectives of an assurance engagement conducted under that Standard, and
the Assurance Framework provides a general description of assurance engagements. An
assurance engagement might either be an attestation engagement or a direct engagement.

900.8

In this Part, the term ‘assurance engagement’ refers to assurance engagements other than audit
engagements and review engagements.

Reports that Include a Restriction on Use and Distribution
900.9

An assurance report might include a restriction on use and distribution. If it does and the
conditions set out in Section 990 are met, then the independence requirements in this Part may
be modified as provided in Section 990.

Audit and Review Engagements
900.10

Independence standards for audit and review engagements are set out in Part 4A –
Independence for Audit and Review Engagements. If a firm performs both an assurance
engagement and an audit or review engagement for the same client, the requirements in Part 4A
continue to apply to the firm, a network firm and the audit or review team members.

Requirements and Application Material
General
R900.11

A firm performing an assurance engagement shall be independent of the assurance client.

900.11 A1

For the purposes of this Part, the assurance client in an assurance engagement is the
responsible party and also, in an attestation engagement, the party taking responsibility for the
subject matter information (who might be the same as the responsible party).

900.11 A2

The roles of the parties involved in an assurance engagement might differ and affect the
application of the independence provisions in this Part. In the majority of attestation
engagements, the responsible party and the party taking responsibility for the subject matter
information are the same. This includes those circumstances where the responsible party
involves another party to measure or evaluate the underlying subject matter against the criteria
(the measurer or evaluator) where the responsible party takes responsibility for the subject matter
information as well as the underlying subject matter. However, the responsible party or the
engaging party might appoint another party to prepare the subject matter information on the basis
that this party is to take responsibility for the subject matter information. In this circumstance, the
responsible party and the party responsible for the subject matter information are both assurance
clients for the purposes of this Part.

900.11 A3

In addition to the responsible party and, in an attestation engagement, the party taking
responsibility for the subject matter information, there might be other parties in relation to the
engagement. For example, there might be a separate engaging party or a party who is a
measurer or evaluator other than the party taking responsibility for the subject matter information.
In these circumstances, applying the conceptual framework requires the professional accountant
to identify and evaluate threats to the fundamental principles created by any interests or
relationships with such parties, including whether any conflicts of interest might exist as described
in Section 310.

SECTION 900 Page 180 of 226

THE CODE

R900.12

A firm shall apply the conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and
address threats to independence in relation to an assurance engagement.

Prohibition on Assuming Management Responsibilities
R900.13

A firm shall not assume a management responsibility related to the underlying subject matter
and, in an attestation engagement, the subject matter information of an assurance engagement
provided by the firm. If the firm assumes a management responsibility as part of any other service
provided to the assurance client, the firm shall ensure that the responsibility is not related to the
underlying subject matter and, in an attestation engagement, the subject matter information of
the assurance engagement provided by the firm.

900.13 A1

Management responsibilities involve controlling, leading and directing an entity, including making
decisions regarding the acquisition, deployment and control of human, financial, technological,
physical and intangible resources.

900.13 A2

When a firm assumes a management responsibility related to the underlying subject matter and,
in an attestation engagement, the subject matter information of an assurance engagement, selfreview, self-interest and familiarity threats are created. Assuming a management responsibility
might create an advocacy threat because the firm becomes too closely aligned with the views
and interests of management.

900.13 A3

Determining whether an activity is a management responsibility depends on the circumstances
and requires the exercise of professional judgement. Examples of activities that would be
considered a management responsibility include:

900.13 A4

•

Setting policies and strategic direction.

•

Hiring or dismissing employees.

•

Directing and taking responsibility for the actions of employees in relation to the
employees’ work for the entity.

•

Authorising transactions.

•

Controlling or managing bank accounts or investments.

•

Deciding which recommendations of the firm or other third parties to implement.

•

Reporting to those charged with governance on behalf of management.

•

Taking responsibility for designing, implementing, monitoring and maintaining internal
control.

Examples of IT systems services that result in the assumption of a management responsibility in
relation to the underlying subject matter and, in an attestation engagement, the subject matter
information of an assurance engagement, include where a firm:
•

•

Stores data or manages (directly or indirectly) the hosting of data related to the underlying
subject matter or subject matter information. Such services include:
o

Acting as the only access to the data or records related to the underlying subject
matter or subject matter information.

o

Taking custody of or storing the data or records related to the underlying subject
matter or subject matter information such that the assurance client’s data or records
are otherwise incomplete.

o

Providing electronic security or back-up services, such as business continuity or a
disaster recovery function, for the assurance client’s data or records related to the
underlying subject matter or subject matter information.

Operates, maintains, or monitors an assurance client’s IT systems, network or website
related to the underlying subject matter or subject matter information.

900.13 A5

The collection, receipt, transmission and retention of data provided by an assurance client in the
course of an assurance engagement or to enable the provision of a permissible non-assurance
service to the assurance client does not result in an assumption of management responsibility.

900.13 A6

Subject to compliance with paragraph R900.14, providing advice and recommendations to assist
the management of an assurance client in discharging its responsibilities is not assuming a
management responsibility.
SECTION 900 Page 181 of 226

THE CODE

R900.14

When performing a professional activity for an assurance client that is related to the underlying
subject matter and, in an attestation engagement, the subject matter information of the assurance
engagement, the firm shall be satisfied that client management makes all related judgements
and decisions that are the proper responsibility of management. This includes ensuring that the
client’s management:
(a)

Designates an individual who possesses suitable skill, knowledge and experience to be
responsible at all times for the client’s decisions and to oversee the activities. Such an
individual, preferably within senior management, would understand:
(i)

The objectives, nature and results of the activities; and

(ii)

The respective client and firm responsibilities.

However, the individual is not required to possess the expertise to perform or re-perform
the activities.

900.14 A1

(b)

Provides oversight of the activities and evaluates the adequacy of the results of the activity
performed for the client’s purpose; and

(c)

Accepts responsibility for the actions, if any, to be taken arising from the results of the
activities.

When technology is used in performing a professional activity for an assurance client, the
requirements in paragraphs R900.13 and R900.14 apply regardless of the nature or extent of
such use of the technology.

Multiple Responsible Parties and Parties Taking Responsibility for the Subject Matter Information
900.15 A1

In some assurance engagements, whether an attestation engagement or direct engagement,
there might be several responsible parties or, in an attestation engagement, several parties taking
responsibility for the subject matter information. In determining whether it is necessary to apply
the provisions in this Part to each individual responsible party or each individual party taking
responsibility for the subject matter information in such engagements, the firm may take into
account certain matters. These matters include whether an interest or relationship between the
firm, or an assurance team member, and a particular responsible party or party taking
responsibility for the subject matter information would create a threat to independence that is not
trivial and inconsequential in the context of the subject matter information. This determination will
take into account factors such as:
(a)

The materiality of the underlying subject matter or subject matter information for which the
particular party is responsible in the context of the overall assurance engagement.

(b)

The degree of public interest associated with the assurance engagement.

If the firm determines that the threat created by any such interest or relationship with a particular
party would be trivial and inconsequential, it might not be necessary to apply all of the provisions
of this section to that party.
Network Firms
R900.16

When a firm knows or has reason to believe that interests and relationships of a network firm
create a threat to the firm’s independence, the firm shall evaluate and address any such threat.

900.16 A1

Network firms are discussed in paragraphs 400.50 A1 to 400.54 A1.

Related Entities
R900.17

When the assurance team knows or has reason to believe that a relationship or circumstance
involving a related entity of the assurance client is relevant to the evaluation of the firm’s
independence from the client, the assurance team shall include that related entity when
identifying, evaluating and addressing threats to independence.

[Paragraphs 900.18 to 900.29 are intentionally left blank]

SECTION 900 Page 182 of 226

THE CODE

Period During which Independence is Required
R900.30

Independence, as required by this Part, shall be maintained during both:
(a)

The engagement period; and

(b)

The period covered by the subject matter information.

900.30 A1

The engagement period starts when the engagement team begins to perform assurance services
with respect to the particular engagement. The engagement period ends when the assurance
report is issued. When the engagement is of a recurring nature, it ends at the later of the
notification by either party that the professional relationship has ended or the issuance of the
final assurance report.

R900.31

If an entity becomes an assurance client during or after the period covered by the subject matter
information on which the firm will express a conclusion, the firm shall determine whether any
threats to independence are created by:
(a)

Financial or business relationships with the assurance client during or after the period
covered by the subject matter information but before accepting the assurance
engagement; or

(b)

Previous services provided to the assurance client.

R900.32

Threats to independence are created if a non-assurance service was provided to the assurance
client during, or after the period covered by the subject matter information, but before the
engagement team begins to perform assurance services, and the service would not be permitted
during the engagement period. In such circumstances, the firm shall evaluate and address any
threat to independence created by the service. If the threats are not at an acceptable level, the
firm shall only accept the assurance engagement if the threats are reduced to an acceptable
level.

900.32 A1

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:

R900.33

•

Using professionals who are not assurance team members to perform the service.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer review the assurance or non-assurance work as
appropriate.

If a non-assurance service that would not be permitted during the engagement period has not
been completed and it is not practical to complete or end the service before the commencement
of professional services in connection with the assurance engagement, the firm shall only accept
the assurance engagement if:
(a)

The firm is satisfied that:
(i)

The non-assurance service will be completed within a short period of time; or

(ii)

The client has arrangements in place to transition the service to another provider
within a short period of time;

(b)

The firm applies safeguards when necessary during the service period; and

(c)

The firm discusses the matter with the party engaging the firm or those charged with
governance of the assurance client.

Communication with Those Charged with Governance
900.34 A1

Paragraphs R300.9 to 300.9 A2 set out requirements and application material that is relevant to
communications with a party engaging the firm or those charged with governance of the
assurance client.

900.34 A2

Communication with a party engaging the firm or those charged with governance of the
assurance client might be appropriate when significant judgements are made, and conclusions
reached, to address threats to independence in relation to an assurance engagement because
the subject matter information of that engagement is the outcome of a previously performed nonassurance service.

[Paragraphs 900.35 to 900.39 are intentionally left blank]

SECTION 900 Page 183 of 226

THE CODE

General Documentation of Independence for Assurance Engagements
R900.40

900.40 A1

A firm shall document conclusions regarding compliance with this Part, and the substance of any
relevant discussions that support those conclusions. In particular:
(a)

When safeguards are applied to address a threat, the firm shall document the nature of
the threat and the safeguards in place or applied; and

(b)

When a threat required significant analysis and the firm concluded that the threat was
already at an acceptable level, the firm shall document the nature of the threat and the
rationale for the conclusion.

Documentation provides evidence of the firm’s judgements in forming conclusions regarding
compliance with this Part. However, a lack of documentation does not determine whether a firm
considered a particular matter or whether the firm is independent.

[Paragraphs 900.41 to 900.49 are intentionally left blank]
Breach of an Independence Provision for Assurance Engagements
When a Firm Identifies a Breach
R900.50

If a firm concludes that a breach of a requirement in this Part has occurred, the firm shall:
(a)

End, suspend or eliminate the interest or relationship that created the breach;

(b)

Evaluate the significance of the breach and its impact on the firm’s objectivity and ability
to issue an assurance report; and

(c)

Determine whether action can be taken that satisfactorily addresses the consequences of
the breach.

In making this determination, the firm shall exercise professional judgement and take into
account whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that the firm’s
objectivity would be compromised, and therefore, the firm would be unable to issue an assurance
report.
R900.51

If the firm determines that action cannot be taken to address the consequences of the breach
satisfactorily, the firm shall, as soon as possible, inform the party that engaged the firm or those
charged with governance, as appropriate. The firm shall also take the steps necessary to end
the assurance engagement in compliance with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements
relevant to ending the assurance engagement.

R900.52

If the firm determines that action can be taken to address the consequences of the breach
satisfactorily, the firm shall discuss the breach and the action it has taken or proposes to take
with the party that engaged the firm or those charged with governance, as appropriate. The firm
shall discuss the breach and the proposed action on a timely basis, taking into account the
circumstances of the engagement and the breach.

R900.53

If the party that engaged the firm does not, or those charged with governance do not concur that
the action proposed by the firm in accordance with paragraph R900.50(c) satisfactorily addresses
the consequences of the breach, the firm shall take the steps necessary to end the assurance
engagement in compliance with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements relevant to
ending the assurance engagement.

Documentation
R900.54

R900.55

In complying with the requirements in paragraphs R900.50 to R900.53, the firm shall document:
(a)

The breach;

(b)

The actions taken;

(c)

The key decisions made; and

(d)

All the matters discussed with the party that engaged the firm or those charged with
governance.

If the firm continues with the assurance engagement, it shall document:
(a)

The conclusion that, in the firm’s professional judgement, objectivity has not been
compromised; and

(b)

The rationale for why the action taken satisfactorily addressed the consequences of the

SECTION 905
FEES
Introduction
905.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

905.2

Fees or other types of remuneration might create a self-interest or intimidation threat. This section
sets out specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual
framework to identify, evaluate and address threats to independence arising from fees charged
to assurance clients.

Requirements and Application Material
Fees Paid by an Assurance Client
905.3 A1

When fees are negotiated with and paid by an assurance client, this creates a self-interest threat
and might create an intimidation threat to independence.

905.3 A2

The application of the conceptual framework requires that before a firm accepts an assurance
engagement for an assurance client, the firm determines whether the threats to independence
created by the fees proposed to the client are at an acceptable level. The application of the
conceptual framework also requires the firm to re-evaluate such threats when facts and
circumstances change during the engagement period.

905.3 A3

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats created when fees are paid by the
assurance client include:
•

The level of the fees for the assurance engagement and the extent to which they have
regard to the resources required, taking into account the firm’s commercial and market
priorities.

•

The extent of any dependency between the level of the fee for, and the outcome of, the
service.

•

The level of the fee in the context of the service to be provided by the firm or a network
firm.

•

The significance of the client to the firm or partner.

•

The nature of the client.

•

The nature of the assurance engagement.

•

The involvement of those charged with governance in agreeing fees.

•

Whether the level of the fee is set by an independent third party, such as a regulatory body.

905.3 A4

The conditions, policies and procedures described in paragraphs 120.15 A3 (particularly the
existence of a quality management system designed and implemented by a firm in accordance
with quality management standards issued by the IAASB) might also impact the evaluation of
whether the threats to independence are at an acceptable level.

905.3 A5

The requirements and application material that follow identify circumstances which might need
to be further evaluated when determining whether the threats are at an acceptable level. For
those circumstances, application material includes examples of additional factors that might be
relevant in evaluating the threats.

Level of Fees for Assurance Engagements
905.4 A1

Determining the fees to be charged to an assurance client, whether for assurance or other
services, is a business decision of the firm taking into account the facts and circumstances
relevant to that specific engagement, including the requirements of technical and professional
standards.

SECTION 905 Page 186 of 226

THE CODE

905.4 A2

905.4 A3

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of self-interest and intimidation threats created
by the level of the fee for an assurance engagement when paid by the assurance client include:
•

The firm’s commercial rationale for the fee for the assurance engagement.

•

Whether undue pressure has been, or is being, applied by the client to reduce the fee for
the assurance engagement.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:
•

Having an appropriate reviewer who does not take part in the assurance engagement
assess the reasonableness of the fee proposed, having regard to the scope and complexity
of the engagement.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who did not take part in the assurance engagement review
the work performed.

Contingent Fees
905.5 A1

Contingent fees are fees calculated on a predetermined basis relating to the outcome of a
transaction or the result of the services performed. A contingent fee charged through an
intermediary is an example of an indirect contingent fee. In this section, a fee is not regarded as
being contingent if established by a court or other public authority.

R905.6

A firm shall not charge directly or indirectly a contingent fee for an assurance engagement.

R905.7

A firm shall not charge directly or indirectly a contingent fee for a non-assurance service provided
to an assurance client if the outcome of the non-assurance service, and therefore the amount of
the fee, is dependent on a future or contemporary judgement related to a matter that is material
to the subject matter information of the assurance engagement.

905.7 A1

Paragraphs R905.6 and R905.7 preclude a firm from entering into certain contingent fee
arrangements with an assurance client. Even if a contingent fee arrangement is not precluded
when providing a non-assurance service to an assurance client, it might still impact the level of
the self-interest threat.

905.7 A2

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:

905.7 A3

•

The range of possible fee amounts.

•

Whether an appropriate authority determines the outcome on which the contingent fee
depends.

•

Disclosure to intended users of the work performed by the firm and the basis of
remuneration.

•

The nature of the service.

•

The effect of the event or transaction on the subject matter information.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:
•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in performing the non-assurance
service review the relevant assurance work.

•

Obtaining an advance written agreement with the client on the basis of remuneration.

Total Fees―Overdue Fees
905.8 A1

The level of the self-interest threat might be impacted if fees payable by the assurance client for
the assurance engagement or other services are overdue during the period of the assurance
engagement.

905.8 A2

It is generally expected that the firm will obtain payment of such fees before the assurance report
is issued.

905.8 A3

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a self-interest threat include:
•

The significance of the overdue fees to the firm.

•

The length of time the fees have been overdue.

•

The firm’s assessment of the ability and willingness of the client or other relevant party to
pay the overdue fee.
SECTION 905 Page 187 of 226

THE CODE

905.8 A4

R905.9

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a threat include:
•

Obtaining partial payment of overdue fees.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who did not take part in the assurance engagement review
the work performed.

When a significant part of the fees due from an assurance client remains unpaid for a long time,
the firm shall determine:
(a)

Whether the overdue fees might be equivalent to a loan to the client, in which case the
requirements and application material set out in Section 911 are applicable; and

(b)

Whether it is appropriate for the firm to be re-appointed or continue the assurance
engagement.

Total Fees―Fee Dependency
905.10 A1

When the total fees generated from an assurance client by the firm expressing the conclusion in
an assurance engagement represent a large proportion of the total fees of that firm, the
dependence on, and concern about the potential loss of, fees from that client impact the level of
the self-interest threat and create an intimidation threat.

905.10 A2

A self-interest and intimidation threat is created in the circumstances described in paragraph
905.10 A1 even if the assurance client is not responsible for negotiating or paying the fees for
the assurance engagement.

905.10 A3

In calculating the total fees of the firm, the firm might use financial information available from the
previous financial year and estimate the proportion based on that information if appropriate.

905.10 A4

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such self-interest and intimidation threats
include:

905.10 A5

•

The operating structure of the firm.

•

Where the firm is expected to diversify such that any dependence on the assurance client
is reduced.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:
•

Reducing the extent of services other than assurance engagements provided to the client.

•

Increasing the client base of the firm to reduce dependence on the assurance client.

905.10 A6

A self-interest or intimidation threat is created when the fees generated by a firm from an
assurance client represent a large proportion of the revenue from an individual partner’s clients.

905.10 A7

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such threats include:

905.10 A8

•

The qualitative and quantitative significance of the assurance client to the partner.

•

The extent to which the compensation of the partner is dependent upon the fees generated
from the client.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest or intimidation threat
include:
•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not an assurance team member review the work.

•

Ensuring that the compensation of the partner is not significantly influenced by the fees
generated from the assurance client.

•

Increasing the client base of the partner to reduce dependence on the client.

When litigation with an assurance client occurs, or appears likely, self-interest and intimidation
threats are created. This section sets out specific application material relevant to applying the
conceptual framework in such circumstances.

Application Material
General
907.3 A1

The relationship between client management and assurance team members must be
characterised by complete candour and full disclosure regarding all aspects of a client’s
operations. Adversarial positions might result from actual or threatened litigation between an
assurance client and the firm or an assurance team member. Such adversarial positions might
affect management’s willingness to make complete disclosures and create self-interest and
intimidation threats.

907.3 A2

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such threats include:
•

The materiality of the litigation.

•

Whether the litigation relates to a prior assurance engagement.

907.3 A3

If the litigation involves an assurance team member, an example of an action that might eliminate
such self-interest and intimidation threats is removing that individual from the assurance team.

907.3 A4

Introduction
910.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

910.2

Holding a financial interest in an assurance client might create a self-interest threat. This section
sets out specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual
framework in such circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
General
910.3 A1

A financial interest might be held directly or indirectly through an intermediary such as a collective
investment vehicle, an estate or a trust. When a beneficial owner has control over the
intermediary or ability to influence its investment decisions, the Code defines that financial
interest to be direct. Conversely, when a beneficial owner has no control over the intermediary
or ability to influence its investment decisions, the Code defines that financial interest to be
indirect.

910.3 A2

This section contains references to the “materiality” of a financial interest. In determining whether
such an interest is material to an individual, the combined net worth of the individual and the
individual’s immediate family members may be taken into account.

910.3 A3

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of a self-interest threat created by holding a
financial interest in an assurance client include:
•

The role of the individual holding the financial interest.

•

Whether the financial interest is direct or indirect.

•

The materiality of the financial interest.

When an entity has a controlling interest in the assurance client and the client is material to the
entity, neither the firm, nor an assurance team member, nor any of that individual’s immediate
family shall hold a direct or material indirect financial interest in that entity.

Financial Interests Held as Trustee
R910.6

Paragraph R910.4 shall also apply to a financial interest in an assurance client held in a trust for
which the firm or individual acts as trustee unless:
(a)

None of the following is a beneficiary of the trust: the trustee, the assurance team member
or any of that individual’s immediate family, or the firm;

(b)

The interest in the assurance client held by the trust is not material to the trust;

(c)

The trust is not able to exercise significant influence over the assurance client; and

(d)

None of the following can significantly influence any investment decision involving a
financial interest in the assurance client: the trustee, the assurance team member or any
of that individual’s immediate family, or the firm.

Financial Interests Received Unintentionally
R910.7

If a firm, an assurance team member, or any of that individual’s immediate family, receives a
SECTION 910 Page 191 of 226

THE CODE

direct financial interest or a material indirect financial interest in an assurance client by way of an
inheritance, gift, as a result of a merger, or in similar circumstances and the interest would not
otherwise be permitted to be held under this section, then:
(a)

If the interest is received by the firm, the financial interest shall be disposed of immediately,
or enough of an indirect financial interest shall be disposed of so that the remaining interest
is no longer material; or

(b)

If the interest is received by an assurance team member, or by any of that individual’s
immediate family, the individual who received the financial interest shall immediately
dispose of the financial interest, or dispose of enough of an indirect financial interest so
that the remaining interest is no longer material.

Financial Interests – Other Circumstances
Close Family
910.8 A1

A self-interest threat might be created if an assurance team member knows that a close family
member has a direct financial interest or a material indirect financial interest in the assurance
client.

910.8 A2

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:

910.8 A3

•

The nature of the relationship between the assurance team member and the close family
member.

•

Whether the financial interest is direct or indirect.

•

The materiality of the financial interest to the close family member.

Examples of actions that might eliminate such a self-interest threat include:
•

910.8 A4

Having the close family member dispose, as soon as practicable, of all of the financial
interest or dispose of enough of an indirect financial interest so that the remaining interest
is no longer material.

Removing the individual from the assurance team.
•
An example of an action that might be a safeguard to address such a self-interest threat is having
an appropriate reviewer review the work of the assurance team member.

Examples of loans include mortgages, bank overdrafts, car loans and credit card balances.

911.5 A2

Even if a firm receives a loan from an assurance client that is a bank or similar institution under
normal lending procedures, terms and conditions, the loan might create a self-interest threat if it
is material to the assurance client or firm receiving the loan.

911.5 A3

An example of an action that might be a safeguard to address such a self-interest threat is having
the work reviewed by an appropriate reviewer, who is not an assurance team member, from a
network firm that is not a beneficiary of the loan.

the assurance client.

Firm, Assurance Team Member or Immediate Family Business Relationships
R920.4

A firm or an assurance team member shall not have a close business relationship with an

member.

Buying Goods or Services
920.5 A1

The purchase of goods and services, including the licensing of technology from an assurance
client by a firm, or an assurance team member, or any of that individual’s immediate family does

The duties and activities performed are limited to those of a routine and administrative
nature, such as preparing minutes and maintaining statutory returns.

The position of Company Secretary has different implications in different jurisdictions. Duties
might range from: administrative duties (such as personnel management and the maintenance
of company records and registers) to duties as diverse as ensuring that the company complies
with regulations or providing advice on corporate governance matters. Usually this position is
seen to imply a close association with the entity. Therefore, a threat is created if a partner or
employee of the firm serves as Company Secretary for an assurance client. (More information

over the subject matter information of the assurance engagement.

Former Partner or Assurance Team Member Restrictions
R924.4

If a former partner has joined an assurance client of the firm or a former assurance team member
has joined the assurance client as:
(a)

A director or officer; or

(b)

An employee in a position to exert significant influence over the underlying subject matter
or, in an attestation engagement, an employee in a position to exert significant influence
over the subject matter information of the assurance engagement, the individual shall not
continue to participate in the firm’s business or professional activities.

924.4 A1

Even if one of the individuals described in paragraph R924.4 has joined the assurance client in
such a position and does not continue to participate in the firm’s business or professional
activities, a familiarity or intimidation threat might still be created.

924.4 A2

A familiarity or intimidation threat might also be created if a former partner of the firm has joined
an entity in one of the positions described in paragraph 924.3 A1 and the entity subsequently
becomes an assurance client of the firm.

924.4 A3

Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such threats include:

924.4 A4

•

The position the individual has taken at the client.

•

Any involvement the individual will have with the assurance team.

•

The length of time since the individual was an assurance team member or partner of the
firm.

•

The former position of the individual within the assurance team or firm. An example is
whether the individual was responsible for maintaining regular contact with the client’s
management or those charged with governance.

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a familiarity or intimidation threat
include:
•

Making arrangements such that the individual is not entitled to any benefits or payments
from the firm, unless made in accordance with fixed pre-determined arrangements.

•

Making arrangements such that any amount owed to the individual is not material to the
firm.

•

Modifying the plan for the assurance engagement.

SECTION 924 Page 201 of 226

THE CODE

•

Assigning to the assurance team individuals who have sufficient experience relative to the
individual who has joined the client.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer review the work of the former assurance team member.

Assurance Team Members Entering Employment Negotiations with a Client
R924.5

A firm shall have policies and procedures that require assurance team members to notify the firm
when entering employment negotiations with an assurance client.

924.5 A1

A self-interest threat is created when an assurance team member participates in the assurance
engagement while knowing that the assurance team member will, or might, join the client
sometime in the future.

924.5 A2

An example of an action that might eliminate such a self-interest threat is removing the individual
from the assurance engagement.

924.5 A3

An example of an action that might be a safeguard to address such a self-interest threat is having
an appropriate reviewer review any significant judgements made by that assurance team
member while on the team.

SECTION 940
LONG ASSOCIATION OF PERSONNEL WITH AN ASSURANCE CLIENT
Introduction
940.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

940.2

When an individual is involved in an assurance engagement of a recurring nature over a long period
of time, familiarity and self-interest threats might be created. This section sets out requirements and
application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.

Requirements and Application Material
General
940.3 A1

A familiarity threat might be created as a result of an individual’s long association with:
(a)

The assurance client;

(b)

The assurance client’s senior management; or

(c)

The underlying subject matter or, in an attestation engagement, subject matter information
of the assurance engagement.

940.3 A2

A self-interest threat might be created as a result of an individual’s concern about losing a
longstanding assurance client or an interest in maintaining a close personal relationship with a
member of senior management or those charged with governance. Such a threat might influence
the individual’s judgement inappropriately.

940.3 A3

Factors that are relevant to evaluating the level of such familiarity or self-interest threats include:
•

The nature of the assurance engagement.

•

How long the individual has been an assurance team member, the individual’s seniority on
the team, and the nature of the roles performed, including if such a relationship existed
while the individual was at a prior firm.

•

The extent to which the work of the individual is directed, reviewed and supervised by more
senior personnel.

•

The extent to which the individual, due to the individual’s seniority, has the ability to
influence the outcome of the assurance engagement, for example, by making key
decisions or directing the work of other engagement team members.

•

The closeness of the individual’s personal relationship with the assurance client or, if
relevant, senior management.

•

The nature, frequency and extent of interaction between the individual and the assurance
client.

•

Whether the nature or complexity of the underlying subject matter or subject matter
information has changed.

•

Whether there have been any recent changes in the individual or individuals at the
assurance client who are responsible for the underlying subject matter or, in an attestation
engagement, the subject matter information or, if relevant, senior management.

940.3 A4

The combination of two or more factors might increase or reduce the level of the threats. For
example, familiarity threats created over time by the increasingly close relationship between an
assurance team member and an individual at the assurance client who is in a position to exert
significant influence over the underlying subject matter or, in an attestation engagement, the
subject matter information, would be reduced by the departure of that individual from the client.

940.3 A5

An example of an action that might eliminate the familiarity and self-interest threats in relation to
a specific engagement would be rotating the individual off the assurance team.

940.3 A6

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such familiarity or self-interest threats
include:

SECTION 940 Page 203 of 226

THE CODE

R940.4

•

Changing the role of the individual on the assurance team or the nature and extent of the
tasks the individual performs.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not an assurance team member review the work
of the individual.

•

Performing regular independent internal or external quality reviews of the engagement.

If a firm decides that the level of the threats created can only be addressed by rotating the individual
off the assurance team, the firm shall determine an appropriate period during which the individual
shall not:
(a)

Be a member of the engagement team for the assurance engagement;

(b)

Perform an engagement quality review, or a review consistent with the objective of an
engagement quality review, for the engagement; or

(c)

Exert direct influence on the outcome of the assurance engagement.

The period shall be of sufficient duration to allow the familiarity and self-interest threats to be
addressed.

SECTION 950
PROVISION OF NON-ASSURANCE SERVICES TO ASSURANCE CLIENTS
Introduction
950.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent, and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

950.2

Firms might provide a range of non-assurance services to their assurance clients, consistent with
their skills and expertise. Providing certain non-assurance services to assurance clients might
create threats to compliance with the fundamental principles and threats to independence.

950.3

This section sets out requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual
framework to identify, evaluate and address threats to independence when providing nonassurance services to assurance clients.

950.4

New business practices, the evolution of financial markets and changes in technology are some
developments that make it impossible to draw up an all-inclusive list of non-assurance services
that firms might provide to an assurance client. The conceptual framework and the general
provisions in this section apply when a firm proposes to a client to provide a non- assurance
service for which there are no specific requirements and application material.

950.5

The requirements and application material in this section apply where a firm:
(a)

Uses technology to provide a non-assurance service to an assurance client; or

(b)

Provides, sells, resells or licenses technology resulting in the provision of a non-assurance
service by the firm:
(i)

To an assurance client; or

(ii)

To an entity that provides services using such technology to assurance clients of
the firm.

Requirements and Application Material
General
Risk of Assuming Management Responsibilities When Providing a Non-Assurance Service
950.6 A1

When a firm provides a non-assurance service to an assurance client, there is a risk that a firm
will assume a management responsibility in relation to the underlying subject matter and, in an
attestation engagement, the subject matter information of the assurance engagement unless the
firm is satisfied that the requirements in paragraphs R900.13 and R900.14 have been complied
with.

Accepting an Engagement to Provide a Non-Assurance Service
R950.7

Before a firm accepts an engagement to provide a non-assurance service to an assurance client,
the firm shall apply the conceptual framework to identify, evaluate and address any threat to
independence that might be created by providing that service.

Identifying and Evaluating Threats
950.8 A1

A description of the categories of threats that might arise when a firm provides a non-assurance
service to an assurance client is set out in paragraph 120.6 A3.

950.8 A2

Factors that are relevant in identifying and evaluating the different threats that might be created
by providing a non-assurance service to an assurance client include:
•

The nature, scope, intended use and purpose of the service.

•

The manner in which the service will be provided, such as the personnel to be involved
and their location.

•

The client’s dependency on the service, including the frequency with which the service will
be provided.

SECTION 950 Page 205 of 226

THE CODE

•

The legal and regulatory environment in which the service is provided.

•

Whether the client is a public interest entity.

•

The level of expertise of the client’s management and employees with respect to the type
of service provided.

•

Whether the outcome of the service will affect the underlying subject matter and, in an
attestation engagement, matters reflected in the subject matter information of the
assurance engagement, and, if so:
o

The extent to which the outcome of the service will have a material effect on the
underlying subject matter and, in an attestation engagement, the subject matter
information of the assurance engagement.

o

The extent to which the assurance client determines significant matters of judgement
(Ref: Para. R900.13 to R900.14).

•

The degree of reliance that will be placed on the outcome of the service as part of the
assurance engagement.

•

The fee relating to the provision of the non-assurance service.

Materiality in Relation to an Assurance Client’s Information
950.9 A1

Materiality is a factor that is relevant in evaluating threats created by providing a non-assurance
service to an assurance client. The concept of materiality in relation to an assurance client’s
subject matter information is addressed in International Standard on Assurance Engagements
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical
Financial Information. The determination of materiality involves the exercise of professional
judgement and is impacted by both quantitative and qualitative factors. It is also affected by
perceptions of the financial or other information needs of users.

Multiple Non-assurance Services Provided to the Same Assurance Client
950.10 A1

A firm might provide multiple non-assurance services to an assurance client. In these
circumstances the combined effect of threats created by providing those services is relevant to
the firm’s evaluation of threats.

Self-Review Threats
950.11 A1

A self-review threat might be created if, in an attestation engagement, the firm is involved in the
preparation of subject matter information which subsequently becomes the subject matter
information of an assurance engagement. Examples of non-assurance services that might create
such self-review threats when providing services related to the subject matter information of an
assurance engagement include:
•

Developing and preparing prospective information and subsequently issuing an assurance
report on this information.

•

Performing a valuation that is related to or forms part of the subject matter information of an
assurance engagement.
Designing, developing, implementing, operating, maintaining, monitoring, updating or
upgrading IT systems or IT controls and subsequently undertaking an assurance
engagement on a statement or report prepared about the IT systems or IT controls.
Designing, developing, implementing, operating, maintaining, monitoring, updating or
upgrading IT systems and subsequently issuing an assurance report on subject matter
information, such as elements of non-financial information, that is prepared from information
generated by such IT systems.

•

•

Assurance clients that are public interest entities
950.12 A1

Expectations about a firm’s independence are heightened when an assurance engagement is
undertaken by a firm for a public interest entity and the results of that engagement will be:
(a)

Made available publicly, including to shareholders and other stakeholders; or

(b)

Provided to an entity or organisation established by law or regulation to oversee the
operation of a business sector or activity.
SECTION 950 Page 206 of 226

THE CODE

Consideration of these expectations forms part of the reasonable and informed third party test
applied when determining whether to provide a non-assurance service to an assurance client.
950.12 A2

If a self-review threat exists in relation to an engagement undertaken in the circumstances
described in paragraph 950.12 A1 (b), the firm is encouraged to disclose the existence of that
self-review threat and the steps taken to address it to the party engaging the firm or those
charged with governance of the assurance client and to the entity or organisation established by
law or regulation to oversee the operation of a business sector or activity to which the results of
the engagement will be provided.

Addressing Threats
950.13 A1

Paragraphs R120.10 to 120.10 A2 include a requirement and application material that are
relevant when addressing threats to independence, including a description of safeguards.

950.13 A2

Threats to independence created by providing a non-assurance service or multiple services to
an assurance client vary depending on facts and circumstances of the assurance engagement
and the nature of the service. Such threats might be addressed by applying safeguards or by
adjusting the scope of the proposed service.

950.13 A3

Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:

950.13 A4

•

Using professionals who are not assurance team members to perform the service.

•

Having an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in providing the service review the
assurance work or service performed.

Safeguards might not be available to reduce the threat created by providing a non-assurance
service to an assurance client to an acceptable level. In such a situation, the application of the
conceptual framework requires the firm to:
(a)

Adjust the scope of the proposed service to eliminate the circumstances that are creating
the threat;

(b)

Decline or end the service that creates the threat that cannot be eliminated or reduced to
an acceptable level; or

(c)

End the assurance engagement.

SECTION 990
REPORTS THAT INCLUDE A RESTRICTION ON USE AND DISTRIBUTION
(ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENTS OTHER THAN AUDIT AND REVIEW ENGAGEMENTS)
Introduction
990.1

Firms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the
conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to
independence.

990.2

This section sets out certain modifications to Part 4B which are permitted in certain
circumstances involving assurance engagements where the report includes a restriction on use
and distribution. In this section, an engagement to issue a restricted use and distribution
assurance report in the circumstances set out in paragraph R990.3 is referred to as an “eligible
assurance engagement.”

Requirements and Application Material
General
R990.3

When a firm intends to issue a report on an assurance engagement which includes a restriction
on use and distribution, the independence requirements set out in Part 4B shall be eligible for
the modifications that are permitted by this section, but only if:
(a)

The firm communicates with the intended users of the report regarding the modified
independence requirements that are to be applied in providing the service; and

(b)

The intended users of the report understand the purpose, subject matter information and
limitations of the report and explicitly agree to the application of the modifications.

990.3 A1

The intended users of the report might obtain an understanding of the purpose, subject matter
information, and limitations of the report by participating, either directly, or indirectly through a
representative who has authority to act for the intended users, in establishing the nature and
scope of the engagement. In either case, this participation helps the firm to communicate with
intended users about independence matters, including the circumstances that are relevant to
applying the conceptual framework. It also allows the firm to obtain the agreement of the intended
users to the modified independence requirements.

R990.4

Where the intended users are a class of users who are not specifically identifiable by name at
the time the engagement terms are established, the firm shall subsequently make such users
aware of the modified independence requirements agreed to by their representative.

990.4 A1

For example, where the intended users are a class of users such as lenders in a syndicated loan
arrangement, the firm might describe the modified independence requirements in an engagement
letter to the representative of the lenders. The representative might then make the firm’s
engagement letter available to the members of the group of lenders to meet the requirement for
the firm to make such users aware of the modified independence requirements agreed to by the
representative.

R990.5

When the firm performs an eligible assurance engagement, any modifications to Part 4B shall
be limited to those modifications set out in paragraphs R990.7 and R990.8.

R990.6

If the firm also issues an assurance report that does not include a restriction on use and
distribution for the same client, the firm shall apply Part 4B to that assurance engagement.

Financial Interests, Loans and Guarantees, Close Business, Family and Personal Relationships
R990.7

When the firm performs an eligible assurance engagement:
(a)

The relevant provisions set out in Sections 910, 911, 920, 921, 922 and 924 need apply
only to the members of the engagement team, and their immediate and close family
members;

(b)

The firm shall identify, evaluate and address any threats to independence created by
interests and relationships, as set out in Sections 910, 911, 920, 921, 922 and 924,
between the assurance client and the following assurance team members;
(i)

Those who provide consultation regarding technical or industry-specific issues,
transactions or events; and
SECTION 990 Page 208 of 226

THE CODE

(ii)
(c)

Those who perform an engagement quality review, or a review consistent with the
objective of an engagement quality review, for the engagement; and

The firm shall evaluate and address any threats that the engagement team has reason to
believe are created by interests and relationships between the assurance client and others
within the firm who can directly influence the outcome of the assurance engagement, as set
out in Sections 910, 911, 920, 921, 922 and 924.

990.7 A1

Others within the firm who can directly influence the outcome of the assurance engagement
include those who recommend the compensation, or who provide direct supervisory,
management or other oversight, of the assurance engagement partner in connection with the
performance of the assurance engagement.

R990.8

When the firm performs an eligible assurance engagement, the firm shall not hold a material
direct or a material indirect financial interest in the assurance client.
